The Leave-One-Out Kernel
 Abstract.  Recently, several attempts have been made for deriving datadependent kernels from distribution estimates with parametric models (e. g.  the Fisher kernel).  In this paper, we propose a new kernel derived from any distribution estimators, parametric or nonparametric.  This kernel is called the Leave-one-out kernel (i. e.  LOO kernel), because the leave-one-out process plays an important role to compute this kernel.  We will show that, when applied to a parametric model, the LOO kernel converges to the Fisher kernel asymptotically as the number of samples goes to infinity.
