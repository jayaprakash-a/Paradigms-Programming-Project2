Bayesian Classification With Gaussian Processes
 Abstract We consider the problem of assigning an input vector x to one of m classes by predicting P (cjx) for c = 1; : : : ; m.  For a two-class problem, the probability of class 1 given x is estimated by oe(y(x)), where oe(y) = 1=(1 + e\Gamma y ).  A Gaussian process prior is placed on y(x), and is combined with the training data to obtain predictions for new x points.  We provide a Bayesian treatment, integrating over uncertainty in y and in the parameters that control the Gaussian process prior; the necessary integration over y is carried out using Laplace's approximation.  The method is generalized to multi-class problems (m ? 2) using the softmax function.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a number of datasets.
