Majority Voting in the Presence of Random Voters
 Abstract The literature about computation in the presence of faulty elements usually deals with worst-case (Byzantine) faults or with fail-stop faults.  In this paper we address an intermediate failure mode, namely random behavior.  We limit the discussion to the effect that random behavior can have on a majority-voting process.  Analytic results for single rounds of votes and for iterative votes are presented; the iterative case is a simple extension of a single round of votes because it is a Markov process.  The concept of quasi-stable states in a Markov process is introduced to account for the characteristics of the consensus states.  Then conditions for reliable voting in the face of random participants are found, using an analogy with a physical system of spins; this eliminates the need for a complex analysis of the Markov matrix.  Indeed, an important contribution of this paper is that it provides an example of a physical model that helps solve a computer-science problem.
