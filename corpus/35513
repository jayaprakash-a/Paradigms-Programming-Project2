Clustering with Expert Opinion
 Abstract Traditional clustering algorithms cannot incorporate domain expert's opinion into the process of clustering.  Since one major goal of clustering is for the experts to gain insight into a dataset, it makes sense to allow experts to have some degree of control over the cluster results.  We propose a mechanism for the experts to request a small number of clustering constraints that they wish to be true.  We devise an algorithm which takes into account the expert constraints and guides the clustering towards them, so that the final clustering satisfies the maximal number of expert constraints while is still reasonably good in traditional measures.  We plan to work on the theory and implementation of this idea, and test it on both synthetic and real world datasets.
