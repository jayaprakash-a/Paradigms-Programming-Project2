Xavier: An Autonomous Mobile Robot on the Web
 Abstract For the past three years, we have been running an experiment in web-based interaction with an autonomous indoor mobile robot.  The robot, Xavier, can accept commands to travel to different offices in our building, broadcasting camera images as it travels.  The experiment, which was originally designed to test a new navigation algorithm, has proven very successful, with over 30,000 requests received and 210 kilometers travelled, to date.  This article describes the autonomous robot system, the web-based interfaces, and how they communicate with the robot.  It highlights lessons learned during this experiment in web-based robotics and includes recommendations for putting future mobile robots on the web.
