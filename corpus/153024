Application of Cluster Variation Method to Genetic Linkage Analysis
 Abstract In this paper we discuss the application of the Cluster Variation Method to the problem of genetic linkage analysis.  The objective of genetic linkage analysis is to link an observed affection status (phenotype) of all individuals in a pedigree to the inheritance pattern observed certain locations on the chromosome.  The Bayesian approach introduced by [7] is computationally intractable for large pedigrees and we propose to apply the Cluster Variation Method to approximately compute quantities such as the likelihood of the data.  We obtain good results on an important subproblem, the computation of the intractable probability distribution of the inheritance pattern.  These results encourage the incorporation of the disease model into the inheritance model.
