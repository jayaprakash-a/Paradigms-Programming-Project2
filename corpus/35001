Spike Sorting: Bayesian Clustering of Non-Stationary Data
 Abstract Spike sorting involves clustering spike trains recorded by a microelectrode according to the source neuron.  It is a complicated problem, which requires a lot of human labor, partly due to the non-stationary nature of the data.  We propose an automated technique for the clustering of non-stationary Gaussian sources in a Bayesian framework.  At a first search stage, data is divided into short time frames and candidate descriptions of the data as a mixture of Gaussians are computed for each frame.  At a second stage transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering is found as the MAP solution of the resulting probabilistic model.  Transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence.  The method was applied to several recordings.  The performance appeared almost indistinguishable from humans in a wide range of scenarios, including movement, merges, and splits of clusters.
