ON THE CURVATURE COLLINEATION IN FINSLER SPACE
 Abstract.  We define # x i = x i + v i (x)t as the h-curvature collineation of a Finsler space, supposing that the Lie derivative of Bervald's curvature tensor is equal to zero.  Then we prove that every motion and every homothetic transformation admitted in a Finsler space are H-curvature collineations.
