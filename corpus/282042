Generalization Error Bounds for Threshold Decision Lists
 Abstract In this paper we consider the generalization accuracy of classification methods based on the iterative use of linear classifiers.  The resulting classifiers, which we call threshold decision lists act as follows.  Some points of the data set to be classified are given a particular classification according to a linear threshold function (or hyperplane).  These are then removed from consideration, and the procedure is iterated until all points are classified.  Geometrically, we can imagine that at each stage, points of the same classification are successively chopped off from the data set by a hyperplane.  We analyse theoretically the generalization properties of
