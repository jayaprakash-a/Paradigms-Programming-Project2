Regularizing Phase-Based Stereo
 Abstract Wavelet-based techniques proved to be a promising approach for estimating the disparity between two stereo images.  The complex-valued Gabor f ilter responses reduce the ambiguity of raw image intensities, and their phase differences between left and right image provide a direct measure for the disparities.  Experience shows that such phasebased measurements are reliable near edges but yield poor results between them.  To improve these phase-based disparity estimations, a regularization scheme is proposed which directly compares possible matching pairs.  Unreliable regions are f illed by using a simple smoothness constraint.  In the spirit of Markov random f ields, we propose a probabilistic lattice model which describes the complete disparity distribution instead of representing only a single conf iguration.  Experimental results are presented for an artif icial image pair generated by computer graphics.
