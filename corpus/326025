Let x = (x1 ; : : : ; xd) be an arbitrary point in ! d .  With each t 2 T we associate a boolean indicator function I t (x) which is 1 if and only if x is in the halfspace t.  The concept class, C d s , that we study consists of all concepts formed by any boolean function over I t 1 ; : : : ; I t s for t i 2 T .  This concept class is much more general than any geometric concept class known to be PAC-learnable.  Our results can be easily extended to efficiently learn any boolean combination of a polynomial number of concepts selected from any concept class C over ! d given that the VC-dimension of C has dependence only on d (and is thus constant for any constant d), and there is a polynomial time algorithm to determine if there is a concept from C consistent with a given set of labeled examples.  We also present a statistical query version of our algorithm that can tolerate random classification noise for any noise rate strictly less than 1/2.  Finally we present a generalization of the standard ffl-net result of Haussler and Welzl [25] and apply it to give an alternative noise-tolerant algorithm for d = 2 based on geometric subdivisions.
