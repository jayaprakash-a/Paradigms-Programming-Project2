Competition and Multiple Cause Models
 Abstract If different causes can interact on any occasion to generate a set of patterns, then systems modelling the generation have to model the interaction too.  We discuss a way of combining multiple causes that is based on the Integrated Segmentation and Recognition architecture of Keeler, Rumelhart and Leow (1991).  It is more co-operative than the scheme embodied in the mixture of experts architecture, which insists that just one cause generate each output, and more competitive than the noisy-or combination function which was recently suggested by Saund (1994a;b).  Simulations confirm its efficacy.
