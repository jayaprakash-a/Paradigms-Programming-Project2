Shrinking the Tube: A New Support Vector Regression Algorithm
 Abstract A new algorithm for Support Vector regression is described.  For a priori chosen , it automatically adjusts a flexible tube of minimal radius to the data such that at most a fraction of the data points lie outside.  Moreover, it is shown how to use parametric tube shapes with non-constant radius.  The algorithm is analysed theoretically and experimentally.
