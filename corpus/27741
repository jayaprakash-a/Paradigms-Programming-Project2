Learning style translation for the lines of a drawing
 MIT We present an example-based method for translating line drawings into different styles.  We fit each line as a linear combination of similar lines in a training set, and interpolate between the corresponding training examples in the output style.  The synthesized lines preserve the desired stylistic features of the output style.
