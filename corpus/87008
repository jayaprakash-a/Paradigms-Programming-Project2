Formal Constraints on Cognitive Interpretations of Causal Structure
 Abstract Human observers are remarkably proficient at extracting the causal structure of both natural and artifactual worlds on the basis of extremely impoverished observations, but a rigorous theory of how they achieve this is elusive.  This paper investigates the formal structure of this problem, collapsing the distinction between human and automatic inference about complex systems, and considering an abstract observer in an abstract world.  We introduce a structure algebra, a reduced description logic that is designed to be biased towards the recovery of causal structure in much the same way as are human observers.  We illustrate how the algebra captures human intuitions about the "natural" interpretation of certain canonic types of observed property covariation.  Finally we propose a formal criterion for the adequacy of a given description language to capture algebraically the "true" causal structure of a particular closed world.
