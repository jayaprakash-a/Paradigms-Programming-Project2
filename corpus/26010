RECOGNITION OF PROSODIC FACTORS AND DETECTION OF LANDMARKS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS
 This thesis examines the usefulness of including prosodic and phonetic context information in the phoneme model of a speech recognizer.  This is done creating a series of prosodic and phonetic models and then comparing the log likelihoods of each model.  The comparison of log likelihoods shows that both prosodic and phonetic context information improve the phoneme model for most phonemes.  The prosodic and phonetic context information is then modeled in two separate recognizers to show that while phonetic context modeling does provide some useful information for the recognizer, prosody provides much more.  This thesis also experiments with the detection of landmarks, the transitions between two phonemes, using binary classification.  The experiments presented show that landmarks can be detected with high accuracy and are useful for phone classification.
