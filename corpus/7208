Multiway Cuts and Spectral Clustering
 Abstract We look at spectral clustering as optimization.  We show that near some special points called perfect, spectral clustering optimizes simultaneously two criteria: a dissimilarity measure that we call the multiway normalized cut (MNCut) and a cluster coherence measure that we call the gap.  The immediate implication from the user's p. o. v is that spectral clustering will optimize any tradeoff between MNCut and gap which may explain its success in practice.  Finally, we propose new methods for selecting K based on the gap and show their superior performance in experiments.
