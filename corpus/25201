THE LUMINOSITY FUNCTION OF MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS WITHIN 80 PARSECS FROM HIPPARCOS DATA
 ABSTRACT The basic data discussed here consist of parallaxes and apparent magnitudes of more than 6000 stars with # <, 26 degrees from the Hipparcos Catalogue which were selected from the Michigan Spectral Catalogue to have estimated spectroscopic distances within 80 parsecs.  The statistical properties of the sample are briefly discussed, and the luminosity function of main sequence stars is determined by the maximum-volume method from nearly 3000 stars with observed parallaxes greater than 12. 5 mas.
