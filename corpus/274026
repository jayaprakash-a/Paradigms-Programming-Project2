Automatic Complexity Control for System Identification
 Abstract As a prerequisite for system identi#cation based on c-mean clustering (FCM), it is necessary to assign the number of underlying partitions to be used for a given data set.  However, for the FCM clustering algorithm it is not known how to assign the number of clusters optimally a priori, and the problem of selecting an appropriate number of clusters is usually treated heuristically.  In this paper we derive a theoretical criterion for assigning the appropriate number of clusters.  We use a generalization of Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) to derive a generic criterion that defines the optimum number of clusters to use for a given problem.  The ecacy of this criterion is illustrated in different experiments, including a benchmark problem involving the prediction of a chaotic time series.
