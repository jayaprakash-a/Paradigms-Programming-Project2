Neural network analysis to predict treatment outcome in patients with ovarian cancer
 Abstract The traditional technique to model survival probabilities is the Cox regression analysis [Cox and Oakes, 1984].  Recently, also neural networks have been applied for survival analysis and the prediction of prognosis in cancer treatment [Liestl K, 1994].  The main advantages of the neural network approach are the relative ease with which time dependencies in prognostic factors can be obtained, the improved prediction performance on independent test data for large numbers of input parameters [Kappen and Neijt, 1993], and the potential to model non-linear relations using hidden units.  Although this last point has only been established on artificial data [De Laurentiis and Ravdin, 1994], it probably constitutes the most important difference for future applications.  Neural networks are different from Cox's survival analysis in both the cost criterion that is optimized, the data model that is being used, and the treatment of censored patients.  In this paper we analyze the differences between the two approaches theoretically.  In addition, we illustrate the time dependent influence of the prognostic factors on a data base of 917 patients on patients with ovarian cancer.
