Mean-shift Blob Tracking through Scale Space
 Abstract The mean-shift algorithm is an efficient technique for tracking 2D blobs through an image.  Although the scale of the mean-shift kernel is a crucial parameter, there is presently no clean mechanism for choosing or updating scale while tracking blobs that are changing in size.  We adapt Lindeberg's theory of feature scale selection based on local maxima of differential scale-space filters to the problem of selecting kernel scale for mean-shift blob tracking.  We show that a difference of Gaussian (DOG) mean-shift kernel enables efficient tracking of blobs through scale space.  Using this kernel requires generalizing the mean-shift algorithm to handle images that contain negative sample weights.
