Thin Junction Tree Filters for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
 Abstract Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics: while a robot navigates in an unknown environment, it must incrementally build a map of its surroundings and localize itself within that map.  Traditional approaches to the problem are based upon Kalman filters, but suffer from complexity issues: the size of the belief state and the time complexity of the filtering operation grow quadratically in the size of the map.  This paper presents a filtering technique that maintains a tractable approximation of the filtered belief state as a thin junction tree.  The junction tree grows under measurement and motion updates and is periodically "thinned" to remain tractable via efficient maximum likelihood projections.  When applied to the SLAM problem, these thin junction tree filters have a linear-space belief state representation, and use a linear-time filtering operation.  Further approximation can yield a constant-time filtering operation, at the expense of delaying the incorporation of observations into the majority of the map.  Experiments on a suite of SLAM problems validate the approach.
