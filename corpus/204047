Quality of Service Guarantees in Mobile Computing
 Abstract With rapid technological advances being made in the area of wireless communications it is expected that, in the near future, mobile users will be able to access a wide variety of services that will be made available over future high-speed networks.  The quality of these services in the high-speed network domain can be specified in terms of several QOS parameters.  In this paper we identify two new QOS parameters unique to the mobile environment -- guarantee of seamless service and ensuring graceful degradation of service in situations where user demands exceed the network's capacity to satisfy them.  A network architecture and a suite of transport level services are proposed that enables these QOS parameters to be satisfied.
