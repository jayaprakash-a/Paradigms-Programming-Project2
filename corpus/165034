INITIALIZING SUBSPACE CONSTRAINED GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS
 ABSTRACT A recent series of papers [1, 2, 3, 4] introduced Subspace Constrained Gaussian Mixture Models (SCGMMs) and showed that SCGMMs can very efficiently approximate Full Covariance Gaussian Mixture Models (FCGMMs); a significant reduction in the number of parameters is achieved with little loss in the accuracy of the model.  SCGMMs were arrived at as a sequence of generalizations of diagonal covariance GMMs.  As an artifact of this process the initialization of SCGMM parameters in that work is complex i. e. , relies on best parameter settings of less general models.  This paper overcomes this problem by showing how an FCGMM can be used to give a simple and direct initialization of an SCGMM.  The initialization scheme is powerful enough that as the number of parameters in an SCGMM approaches that of an FCGMM (i. e. , large SCGMMs) further training of the SCGMM is unnecessary.
