Critical Behavior at the k-Satisfiability Threshold
 Abstract The satisfiability of random Boolean formulae with precisely k variables per clause is a popular testbed for the performance of search algorithms in artificial intelligence and computer science.  For k = 2, formulae are almost aways satisfiable when the ratio of clauses to variables is less than 1; for ratios larger than 1, the formulae are almost never satisfiable.  We present data showing a similar threshold behavior for higher values of k.  We also show how finite-size scaling, a method from statistical physics, can be used to characterize size dependent effects near the threshold.  Finally, we commment on the relationship between thresholds and computational complexity.
