On Photometric Issues in 3D Visual Recognition From A Single 2D Image
 Abstract.  We describe the problem of recognition under changing illumination conditions and changing viewing positions from a computational and human vision perspective.  On the computational side we focus on the mathematical problems of creating an equivalence class for images of the same 3D object undergoing certain groups of transformations --- mostly those due to changing illumination, and briefly discuss those due to changing viewing positions.  The computational treatment culminates in proposing a simple scheme for recognizing, via alignment, an image of a familiar object taken from a novel viewing position and a novel illumination condition.  On the human vision aspect, the paper is motivated by empirical evidence inspired by Mooney images of faces that suggest a relatively high level of visual processing is involved in compensating for photometric sources of variability, and furthermore, that certain limitations on the admissible representations of image information may exist.  The psychophysical observations and the computational results that follow agree in several important respects, such as the same (apparent) limitations on image representations.
