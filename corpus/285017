Pedestrian Detection for Driving Assistance Systems: Single-frame Classification and System Level Performance
 Abstract We describe the functional and architectural breakdown of a monocular pedestrian detection system.  We describe in detail our approach for single-frame classification based on a novel scheme of breaking down the class variability by repeatedly training a set of relatively simple classifiers on clusters of the training set.  Single-frame classification performance results and system level performance figures for daytime conditions are presented with a discussion about the remaining gap to meet a daytime normal weather condition production system.
