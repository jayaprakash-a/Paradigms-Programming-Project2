Canonical correlation analysis; An overview with application to learning methods
 Abstract We present a general method using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis to learn a semantic representation to web images and their associated text.  The semantic space provides a common representation and enables a comparison between the text and images.  In the experiments we look at two approaches of retrieving images based only on their content from a text query.  We compare the approaches against a standard cross-representation retrieval technique known as the Generalised Vector Space Model.
