Texture Deconvolution for the Fourier-Based Analysis of Non-Rectangular Regions
 Abstract Fourier analysis is often used as a tool to facilitate the extraction of texture information from image data.  However, in situations where the texture patch does not entirely fill the region of analysis, information relating to the shape of the patch becomes entwined with its texture content, thus contaminating the Fourier spectrum and corrupting the texture information.  We propose the use of a frequency deconvolution algorithm to remove the artefacts introduced by shape components, permitting the Fourier-based analysis of non-rectangular image patches.  The algorithm is demostrated on a texture recognition task involving the entire Brodatz album.
