HETEROGENEOUS INTEGRATION OF BIOMIMETIC ACOUSTIC MICROSYSTEMS
 ABSTRACT We discuss biologically inspired devices and architectures for acoustic processing microsystems.  We exploit state of the art integrated microsytems technologies to heterogeneously integrate electronics and micromechanical structures for acoustic sensing and signal processing.
