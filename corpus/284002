 Abstract We describe a new method for performing a nonlinear form of Principal Component Analysis.  By the use of integral operator kernel functions, we can efficiently compute principal components in high--dimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear map; for instance the space of all possible 5--pixel products in 16\Theta16 images.  We give the derivation of the method, along with a discussion of other techniques which can be made nonlinear with the kernel approach; and present first experimental results on nonlinear feature extraction for pattern recognition.
