Improving Face Verification Using Skin Color Information
 Abstract The performance of face verification systems has steadily improved over the last few years, mainly focusing on models rather than on feature processing.  State-of-the-art methods often use the gray-scale face image as input.  In this paper, we propose to use an additional feature to the face image: the skin color.  The new feature set is tested on a benchmark database, namely XM2VTS, using a simple discriminant artificial neural network.  Results show that the skin color information improves the performance.
