Poisson image editing
 Abstract Using generic interpolation machinery based on solving Poisson equations, a variety of novel tools are introduced for seamless editing of image regions.  The first set of tools permits the seamless importation of both opaque and transparent source image regions into a destination region.  The second set is based on similar mathematical ideas and allows the user to modify the appearance of the image seamlessly, within a selected region.  These changes can be arranged to affect the texture, the illumination, and the color of objects lying in the region, or to make tileable a rectangular selection.
