Early Detection and Trellis Splicing: Reduced-Complexity Iterative Decoding
 Abstract The excellent bit error rate performance of new soft iterative decoding algorithms (eg. , turbo-codes) is achieved at the expense of a computationally burdensome iterative decoding procedure.  In this paper, we present a new method called early detection that can be used to reduce the computational complexity of a variety of soft iterative decoding methods.  Using a confidence criterion, some information symbols, state variables and codeword symbols are detected early on in the iterative decoding procedure, leading to a reduction in the computational complexity of further processing.  After presenting a general Markov random field framework (eg. , the Tanner graph) for compound codes, we use this framework to show how early detection leads to computational savings.  We then present an easily implemented instance of this algorithm, called trellis splicing, that can be used with turbo-codes.  For a simulated turbo-code system, at low BERs we obtain a reduction in computational complexity of over a factor of four relative to conventional turbo-decoding, without any increase in BER.
