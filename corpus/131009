Matching Perspective Views of Coplanar Structures using Projective Unwarping and Similarity Matching
 Abstract We consider the problem of matching perspective views of coplanar structures composed of line segments.  Both model-to-image and image-to-image correspondence matching are given a consistent treatment.  These matching scenarios generally require discovery of an eight parameter projective mapping.  However, when the horizon line of the object plane can be found in the image, done here using vanishing point analysis, these problems reduce to a simpler six parameter affine matching problem.  When the intrinsic lens parameters of the camera are known, the problem further reduces to four parameter affine similarity matching.
