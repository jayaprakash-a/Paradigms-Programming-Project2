An Experimental Study of Polylogarithmic, Fully Dynamic, Connectivity Algorithms
 We present an experimental study of different variants of the amortized O(log 2 n)-time fullydynamic connectivity algorithm of Holm, de Lichtenberg, and Thorup (STOC'98).  The experiments build upon experiments provided by Alberts, Cattaneo, and Italiano (SODA'96) on the randomized amortized O(log 3 n) fully-dynamic connectivity algorithm of Henzinger and King (STOC'95).  Our experiments shed light upon similarities and differences between the two algorithms.  We also present a slightly modified version of the Henzinger-King algorithm that runs in O(log 2 n) time, which resulted from our experiments.
