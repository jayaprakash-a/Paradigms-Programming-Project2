Robust registration of 2D and 3D point sets
 Abstract This paper introduces a new method of registering point sets.  The registration error is directly minimized using general-purpose nonlinear optimization (the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm).  The surprising conclusion of the paper is that this technique is comparable in speed to the special-purpose ICP algorithm which is most commonly used for this task.  Because the routine directly minimizes an energy function, it is easy to extend it to incorporate robust estimation via a Huber kernel, yielding a basin of convergence that is many times wider than existing techniques.  Finally we introduce a data structure for the minimization based on the chamfer distance transform which yields an algorithm which is both faster and more robust than previously described methods.
