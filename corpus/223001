Capturing characteristic structural features for motif detection using a hierarchical Bayesian Markovian model
 Abstract The detection of novel DNA motifs in the regulatory regions of genes provides important information regarding the organization and functional mechanisms of gene regulation.  A wealth of biological evidence suggest that biological motifs are more than just conserved nucleotide strings but may have common structural properties underlying the seemingly diverse consensus sequences, such as characteristic positional dependencies and nucleotide composition.  This subtle but valuable information is hard to capture and often ignored in most existing motif finders, rendering them incapable of distinguishing biologically more plausible motifs from trivial or biologically meaningless recurrent patterns.  In this paper, we present HMDM, a novel dynamic Bayesian model for motifs in biopolymer sequences.  HMDM is a hidden Markov Dirichletmultinomial model which captures rich biological prior knowledge and positional dependencies in motif local structure in a principled way.  We also bring to bear the variational EM algorithm, a deterministic and highly efficient optimization algorithm for model fitting, Bayesian estimation of motif parameters and inference of locations of hidden motifs.  Our model improves over existing models that ignore biological priors and positional dependencies.  It shows higher sensitivity to motifs, notable ability to distinguish genuine motifs from false recurring patterns and flexibility for complex detection tasks.  Serving as a local alignment component of the LOGOS [20] 1 model in a real multiple motif detection task, HMDM is able to recognize several known motifs, as well as ex# To whom correspondence should be addressed.
