Decay in Perturbative QCD Approach
 Abstract The rare decay B 0 ! fiff can occur only via penguin annihilation topology in the standard model.  We calculate this channel in the perturbative QCD approach.  The predicted branching ratio is very small at (10- 8 ).  We also give the polarization fractions, which shows that the transverse polarization contribution is comparable to the longitudinal one, due to a big transverse contribution from factorizable diagrams.  The small branching ratio in SM, makes it sensitive to any new physics contributions.
