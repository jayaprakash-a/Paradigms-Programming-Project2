Beyond Gigabit Ethernet: Physical Layer Issues in Future Optical Networks
 Abstract: This paper presents a study of the errors observed on an optical Gigabit Ethernet link in a state of low receiver power.  This condition is increasingly likely as networks become more complex, with longer fibre lengths, optical switching systems and higher data rates.  We discover that some octets and sequences of octets have a far higher probability of being received in error than others.  This non-uniformity of error in the physical layer may severely affect network performance at higher levels, and should be carefully considered as the next generation of optical networks is developed.
