Power-law for axon diameters at branch point
 Results: We pursue the hypothesis that the axon caliber has evolved to minimize signal propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume to a minimum.  For a general cost function, we show that the optimal diameters of mother and daughter branches at a bifurcation satisfy a power law.  The derivation relies on the fact that the axon conduction speed scales as a power of axon diameter.  Although available data are consistent with the law, there is a large spread in the data.  Future experimental tests will determine whether this spread is due to biological variability or measurement error.
