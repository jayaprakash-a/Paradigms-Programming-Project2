A Theoretical and Empirical Study of a Noise-Tolerant Algorithm to Learn Geormetric Patterns
 Abstract Developing the ability to recognize a landmark from a visual image of a robot's current location is a fundamental problem in robotics.  We describe a way in which the landmark matching problem can be mapped to that of learning a one-dimensional geometric pattern.  We present an efficient noisetolerant algorithm (designed using the statistical query model) to PAC-learn the class of one-dimensional geometric patterns.  Then we report results from an initial empirical study of our algorithm that provides at least some evidence that statistical query algorithms may be valuable for use in practice.
