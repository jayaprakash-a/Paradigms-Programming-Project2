A probability model for golf putting
 Abstract We derive a model, using trigonometry and the normal distribution, for the probability that a golf putt is successful.  We describe a class activity in which we lead the students through the steps of examining the data, considering possible models, constructing a probability model, and checking the fit.  The model is, of necessity, oversimplified, a point which the class discusses at the end of the demonstration.  1 Looking at data on golf putts Golf is a harder game than it looks.  A study of professional golf players found that they made less than 60% of their #ve-foot putts.  Figure 1 shows the success rate of golf putts as a function of distance from the hole.  (We found these data in the textbook by Berry, 1995, and this example is discussed further in Gelman and Nolan, 2001.  Further quantitative information on golf putting appears in Pelz, 1989. ) What do these data tell us about the accuracy of
