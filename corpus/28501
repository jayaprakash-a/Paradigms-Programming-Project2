Solid or not solid: Vision for radar target validation
 Abstract In the context of combining Radar and Vision sensors for a fusion application in dense city traffic situations, one of the major challenges is to be able to validate Radar targets.  We take a high-level fusion approach assuming that both sensor modalities have the capacity to independently locate and identify targets of interest.  In this context, Radar targets can either correspond to a Vision target --- in which case the target is validated without further processing --or not.  It is the latter case that drives the focus of this paper.  A non-matched Radar target can correspond to some solid object which is not part of the objects of interest of the Vision sensor (such as a guard-rail) or can be caused by reflections in which case it is a ghost target which does not match any physical object in the real world.  We describe a number of computational steps for the decision making of non-matched Radar targets.  The computations combine both direct motion parallax measurements and indirect motion analysis --- which are not sufficient for computing parallax but are nevertheless quite effective --- and pattern classification steps for covering situations which motion analysis are weak or ineffective.  One of the major advantages of our high-level fusion approach is that it allows the use of simpler (low cost) Radar technology to create a combined high performance system.
