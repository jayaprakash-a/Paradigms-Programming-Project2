Data Mining: An AI Perspective
 0 Abstract--Data mining, or knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), is an interdisciplinary area that integrates techniques from several fields including machine learning, statistics, and database systems, for the analysis of large volumes of data.  This paper reviews the topics of interest from the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) from an AI perspective.  We discuss common topics in data mining and AI, including key AI ideas that have been used in both data mining and machine learning.
