SVMSVM: SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE SPEAKER VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY
 ABSTRACT Support vector machines with the Fisher and score-space kernels are used for text independent speaker verification to provide direct discrimination between complete utterances.  This is unlike approaches such as discriminatively trained Gaussian mixture models or other discriminative classifiers that discriminate at the frame-level only.  Using the sequence-level discrimination approach we are able to achieve error-rates that are significantly better than the current state-of-the-art on the PolyVar database.
