Rapid categorisation of achromatic natural scenes: how robust at very low contrasts?
 Abstract The human visual system is remarkably good at categorising objects even in challenging visual conditions.  Here we specifically assessed the robustness of the visual system to large variations of contrast in a high-level categorisation task using natural images.  Human subjects performed a go/no-go animal/non-animal categorisation task with briefly flashed grey level images.  Performance was analysed for a large range of contrast conditions randomly presented to the subjects and varying from normal to 3% of initial contrast.  Accuracy was very robust and subjects were performing well above chance level (around 70% correct) with only 12-25% of initial contrast.  Accuracy decreased with contrast reduction but reached chance level only in the most extreme condition (3% of initial contrast).  Conversely, mean reaction time increased, to reach a maximal augmentation of about 60 ms (at 8% of initial contrast) that remained stable with further contrast reductions.  Associated ERPs recorded on correct target and distractor trials showed a clear differential effect whose amplitude and peak latency were respectively correlated with task accuracy and mean reaction times.  These data show the strong robustness of the visual system in object categorisation at very low contrast.  They suggest that magnocellular information could play a role in ventral stream visual functions such as object recognition.  Performance may rely on early object representations that lack the details provided subsequently by the parvocellular system but contain enough information to reach decision in the categorisation task.
