Statistical Models for Relational Data
 Abstract.  We introduce a new type of probabilistic model for relational domains, a statistical relational model (SRM).  An SRM is a statistical model of a particular database instantiation.  The SRM captures the tuple frequencies in the database, and in particular the SRM captures the frequencies with which tuples join.  The SRM provides a compact model of a data base and can be used to quickly give (approximate) answers to queries on this database.  Because it models a joint distribution over tuples from multiple tables, it is ideally to mining multi-relational databases.  We describe the semantics of SRMs and a learning algorithm for SRMs.  We provide experimental results showing that using only a small fraction of the space of the original database, we can still accurately answer a wide range of queries.
