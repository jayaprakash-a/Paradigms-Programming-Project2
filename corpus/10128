3D PHOTOGRAPHY USING SHADOWS
 ABSTRACT A simple and inexpensive approach for extracting the threedimensional shape of objects is presented.  It is based on `weak structured lighting;' and requires little hardware besides the camera: a light source (a desk-lamp or the sun), a stick and a checkerboard.  The object, illuminated by the light source, is placed on a stage composed of a ground plane and a back plane; the camera faces the object.  The user moves the stick in front of the light source, casting a moving shadow on the scene.  The 3D shape of the object is extracted from the spatial and temporal location of the observed shadow.  Experimental results are presented on three different scenes (indoor with a desk lamp and outdoor with the sun) demonstrating that the error in reconstructing the surface is less than 0:5% of the size of the object.
