Texture and Shape Synthesis on Surfaces
 Abstract.  We present a novel method for texture synthesis on surfaces from examples.  We consider a very general type of textures, including color, transparency and displacements.  Our method synthesizes the texture directly on the surface, rather than synthesizing a texture image and then mapping it to the surface.  The synthesized textures have the same qualitative visual appearance as the example texture, and cover the surfaces without the distortion or seams of conventional texture-mapping.  We describe two synthesis methods, based on the work of Wei and Levoy and Ashikhmin; our techniques produce similar results, but directly on surfaces.
