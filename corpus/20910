The European data format for bio-signals (EDF) is a widely accepted standard.  This paper proposes modifications to overcome some limitations of EDF.  In addition to 16-bit integer numbers, various other data types including floating point numbers and strings are supported.  Moreover, the Y2K problem is addressed and an automatic overflow detection of the data is incorporated.  Data can be stored in time-based as well as in channel-based order.  Some preparatory measures for a quality management system in recording scientific data in the clinical routine are implemented, e. g.  fields for the identification of the equipment provider, serial number, lab, and technician included.  Since the modifications are not possible within the present definition of EDF, the proposed format is named "A General Data format for Biosignals" (GDF).
