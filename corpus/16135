models for speech and speaker recognition
 Abstract.  Generative probability models such as Hidden Markov Models are usually used for modeling sequences of data because of their ability to handle variable size sequences and missing information.  On the other hand, because of their discriminative properties, discriminative models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) usually yield better performance in classification problem and can construct flexible decision boundaries.  An ideal classifier should have all the power of these two complementary approaches.  A series of recent papers has suggested some techniques for mixing generative models and discriminative models.  In one of them a fixed size vector (the Fisher score) containing sufficient statistics of a sequence is computed for a previously trained HMM and can then be used as input to a discriminative model for classification.  The purpose of this project is thus to study, experiment, enhance and adapt these new approaches of integrating discriminative models such as SVM into generative models for sequence processing problems, such as speaker and speech recognition.
