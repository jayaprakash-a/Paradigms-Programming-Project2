The Optimal Elastic Net: Finding Solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem
 Abstract We introduce the optimal elastic net (OEN) method for finding solutions to the travelling salesman problem (TSP).  The OEN method is related to the elastic net (EN) method[1].  The EN method encourages each city to become associated with at least one unit, and requires a large number of units in order to ensure that each city is matched to a unit at convergence.  In contrast, the OEN method encourages each city to become associated with at least one unit, and each unit to become associated with at least one city.  One consequence of this is that the OEN method requires fewer units than the EN method.  The OEN method has applications for problems in which there are two sets of variable (movable) components (e. g.  VLSI placement), and an arrangement of components is required which minimises the total interconnect length between the two sets.
