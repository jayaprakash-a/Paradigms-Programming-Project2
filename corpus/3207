A New Method for Tracking Modulations in Tonal Music in Audio Data Format
 Abstract Cq-profiles are 12-dimensional vectors, each component referring to a pitch class.  They can be employed to represent keys.  Cq-profiles are calculated with the constant Q filter bank [4].  They have the following advantages: (i) They correspond to probe tone ratings.  (ii) Calculation is possible in real-time.  (iii) Stability is obtained with respect to sound quality.  (iv) They are transposable.  By using the cq-profile technique as a simple auditory model in combination with the SOM [11] an arrangement of keys emerges, that resembles results from psychological experiments [13], and from music theory [1].  Cq-profiles are reliably applied to modulation tracking by introducing a special distance measure.
