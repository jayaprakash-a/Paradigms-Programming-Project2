Bilinear Dynamical Systems
 Abstract In this paper we propose the use of Bilinear Dynamical Systems (BDS) for model-based deconvolution of fMRI time series.  The importance of this work lies in being able to deconvolve hemodynamic timeseries, in an informed way, to disclose the underlying neuronal activity.  Being able to estimate neuronal responses in a particular brain region is fundamental for many models of functional integration and connectivity in the brain.  BDSs comprise a stochastic bilinear neurodynamical model specified in discrete-time and a set of linear convolution kernels for the hemodynamics.  We derive an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, in which fMRI time series are deconvolved in an E-step and model parameters are updated in an M-Step.  We report preliminary results that focus on the assumed stochastic nature of the neurodynamic model and compare the method to Wiener deconvolution.
