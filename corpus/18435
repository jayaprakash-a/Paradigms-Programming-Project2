Evolution of a Tri-State Frequency Discriminator for the Source Identification Problem using Genetic Programming
 KEYWORDS Genetic programming, Automated design of analog electrical circuits, Source identification problem, Frequency discrimination ABSTRACT Automated synthesis of analog electronic circuits is recognized as a difficult problem.  Genetic programming was used to evolve both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) for each component of a circuit that can perform source identification by correctly classify an incoming signal into categories.
