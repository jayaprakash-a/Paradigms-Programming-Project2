The Local Projective Shape of Smooth Surfaces and their Outlines
 Abstract This paper examines projectively invariant local properties of smooth curves and surfaces.  Oriented projective differential geometry is proposed as a theoretical framework for establishing such invariants and describing the local shape of surfaces and their outlines.  This framework is applied to two problems: a projective proof of Koenderink's famous characterization of convexities, concavities, and inflections of apparent contours; and the determination of the relative orientation of rim tangents at frontier points.
