On Representation Theory in Computer Vision Problems \Lambda
 Abstract We introduce the following general question: Let V be a complex n-dimensional space and for m k consider the GL(V )-module V (n# m# k) ae V \Omegam defined by V (n# m# k)=f v 1 \Omega \Delta\Delta\Delta \Omega vm 2 V \Omegam : dim Spanfv 1 #:::#v mgk g : We would like to determine dim V (n# m# k) for any choice of n# m k.  This question appears in various disguises in computer vision problems where the constraints of a multi-linear problem occupy a lowdimensional subspace.  We discuss two such problems: analysis of constraints in single view indexing functions (the 8-point shape tensor), and the analysis of the constraints in dynamic P n ! P n alignments, i. e. , where the point sets are allowed to move within a k-dimensional subspace while the n-dimensional space is being multiply projected (multiple views) onto copies of the m-dimensional space.  We then derive the solution to the general problem using tools from representation theory.
