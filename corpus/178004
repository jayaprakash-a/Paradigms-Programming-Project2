Analog VLSI Cellular Implementation of the Boundary Contour System
 Abstract We present an analog VLSI cellular architecture implementing a simplified version of the Boundary Contour System (BCS) for real-time image processing.  Inspired by neuromorphic models across several layers of visual cortex, the design integrates in each pixel the functions of simple cells, complex cells, hyper-complex cells, and bipole cells, in three orientations interconnected on a hexagonal grid.  Analog current-mode CMOS circuits are used throughout to perform edge detection, local inhibition, directionally selective long-range diffusive kernels, and renormalizing global gain control.  Experimental results from a fabricated ######### pixel prototype in 1. 2 # m CMOS technology demonstrate the robustness of the architecture in selecting image contours in a cluttered and noisy background.
