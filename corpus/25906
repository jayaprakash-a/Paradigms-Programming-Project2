Efficient Exploration In Reinforcement Learning
 Abstract Exploration plays a fundamental role in any active learning system.  This study evaluates the role of exploration in active learning and describes several local techniques for exploration in finite, discrete domains, embedded in a reinforcement learning framework (delayed reinforcement).  This paper distinguishes between two families of exploration schemes: undirected and directed exploration.  While the former family is closely related to random walk exploration, directed exploration techniques memorize exploration-specific knowledge which is used for guiding the exploration search.  In many finite deterministic domains, any learning technique based on undirected exploration is inefficient in terms of learning time, i. e.  learning time is expected to scale exponentially with the size of the state space (Whitehead, 1991b) .  We prove that for all these domains, reinforcement learning using a directed technique can always be performed in polynomial time, demonstrating the important role of exploration in reinforcement learning.  (The proof is given for one specific directed exploration technique named counter-based exploration. ) Subsequently, several exploration techniques found in recent reinforcement learning and connectionist adaptive control literature are described.  In order to trade off efficiently between exploration and exploitation -a trade-off which characterizes many real-world active learning tasks -- combination methods are described which explore and avoid costs simultaneously.  This includes a selective attention mechanism, which allows smooth switching between exploration and exploitation.  All techniques are evaluated and compared on a discrete reinforcement learning task (robot navigation).  The empirical evaluation is followed by an extensive discussion of benefits and limitations of this work.
