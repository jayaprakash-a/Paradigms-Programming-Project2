Representational Difficulties with Classifier Systems
 ABSTRACT Classifier systems are currently in vogue as a way of using genetic algorithms to demonstrate machine learning.  However, there are a number of difficulties with the formalization that can influence how knowledge is represented and the rate at which the system can learn.  Some of the problems are inherent in classifier systems, and one must learn to cope with them, while others are pitfalls waiting to catch the unsuspecting implementor.  This paper identifies some of these difficulties, suggesting directions for the further evolution of classifier systems.
