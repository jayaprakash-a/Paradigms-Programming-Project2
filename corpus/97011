Policy-contingent abstraction for robust robot control
 Abstract This paper presents a scalable control algorithm that enables a deployed mobile robot to make high-level control decisions under full consideration of its probabilistic belief.  We draw on insights from the rich literature of structured robot controllers and hierarchical MDPs to propose PolCA, a hierarchical probabilistic control algorithm which learns both subtask-specific state abstractions and policies.  The resulting controller has been successfully implemented onboard a mobile robotic assistant deployed in a nursing facility.  To the best of our knowledge, this work is a unique instance of applying POMDPs to highlevel robotic control problems.
