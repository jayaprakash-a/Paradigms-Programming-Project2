Cryptanalysis of the SIGABA A Thesis submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree Master of Science in Computer Science
 The SIGABA is a rotor-based cryptosystem developed by the United States for use during World War II.  Its history has been shrouded in secrecy, with the result that few people know of its significance in securing American communications during and after World War II.  SIGABA's operational details were finally declassified in 1996, and the patent for its design was granted in 2001, more than 50 years after it was filed.  In this thesis I present a generic model of rotor-based cryptosystems that represents a machine at least as difficult to break as the SIGABA.  I present techniques that can be used for full plaintext recovery on a cryptosystem using one to three rotors, and I show how these techniques can be extended to systems using more rotors.  These attacks compromise not only the generic model, but also the SIGABA and related cryptosystems.
