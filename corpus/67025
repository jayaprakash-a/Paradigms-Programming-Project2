Mining Home Video for Photos
 More and more home videos have been generated with the ever growing popularity of digital cameras and camcorders.  In many cases of home video, a photo, whether capturing a moment or a scene within the video, provides a complementary representation to the video.  In this paper, a complete solution of video to photo is presented.  The intent of the user is first derived by analyzing video motions.  Then, photos are produced accordingly from the video.  They can be keyframes at video highlights, panorama of the scene, or high-resolution frames.  Methods and results of camera motion mining, intelligent keyframe extraction, video frame stitching and super-resolution enhancement are described.
