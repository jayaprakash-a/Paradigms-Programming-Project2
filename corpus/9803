An Algorithm for Modifying Neurotransmitter Release Probability Based on Pre- and Postsynaptic Spike Timing
 The precise times of occurrence of individual pre- and postsynaptic action potentials are known to play a key role in the modi cation of synaptic efcacy.  Based on stimulation protocols of two synaptically connected neurons, we infer an algorithm that reproduces the experimental data by modifying the probability of vesicle discharge as a function of the relative timing of spikes in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.  The primary feature of this algorithm is an asymmetry with respect to the direction of synaptic modi cation depending on whether the presynaptic spikes precede or follow the postsynaptic spike.  Speci cally, if the presynaptic spike occurs up to 50 ms before the postsynaptic spike, the probability of vesicle discharge is upregulated, while the probability of vesicle discharge is downregulated if the presynaptic spike occurs up to 50 ms after the postsynaptic spike.  When neurons re irregularly with Poisson spike trains at constant mean ring rates, the probability of vesicle discharge converges toward a characteristic value determined by the preand postsynaptic ring rates.  On the other hand, if the mean rates of the Poisson spike trains slowly change with time, our algorithm predicts modi cations in the probability of release that generalize Hebbian and Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rules.  We conclude that the proposed spikebased synaptic learning algorithm provides a general framework for regulating neurotransmitter release probability.
