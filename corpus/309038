Modeling Freeway Traffic with Coupled HMMs
 Abstract We consider the problem of modeling loop detector data collected from freeways.  The data, which is a vector time-series, contains the speed of vehicles, averaged over a 30 second sampling window, at a number of sites along the freeway.  We assume the measured speed at each location is generated from a hidden discrete variable, which represents the underlying state (e. g. , congested or free-flowing) of the traffic at that point in space and time.  We further assume that the hidden variables only depend on their spatial-temporal neighbors.  Such a model is called a coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM).  We can fit the parameters of this model using EM.  However, since exact inference is intractable, we consider two different approximation schemes: one based on a sequential Monte Carlo technique (particle filtering), and the other based on the Boyen-Koller (BK) algorithm.  We show that both algorithms perform well, compared to exact inference, and that the resulting learned model captures many important features of the data.  Such a macroscopic model could prove useful for fault diagnosis, and in predicting future traffic patterns, particularly in response to causal interventions.
