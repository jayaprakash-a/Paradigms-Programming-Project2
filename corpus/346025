Automatic detection of human nudes
 Abstract.  This paper demonstrates an automatic system for telling whether there are human nudes present in an image.  The system marks skin-like pixels using combined color and texture properties.  These skin regions are then fed to a specialized grouper, which attempts to group a human figure using geometric constraints on human structure.  If the grouper finds a su/ciently complex structure, the system decides a human is present.  The approach is shown to be e0ective for a wide range of shades and colors of skin and human configurations.  This approach o0ers an alternate view of object recognition, where an object model is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts.  The system demonstrates excellent performance on a test set of 565 uncontrolled images of human nudes, mostly obtained from the internet, and 4289 assorted control images, drawn from a wide variety of sources.
