The Design Principles of a Weighted Finite-State Transducer Library
 Abstract We describe the algorithmic and software design principles of an object-oriented library for weighted finite-state transducers.  By taking advantage of the theory of rational power series, we were able to achieve high degrees of generality, modularity and irredundancy, while attaining competitive efficiency in demanding speech processing applications involving weighted automata of more than 10 7 states and transitions.  Besides its mathematical foundation, the design also draws from important ideas in algorithm design and programming languages: dynamic programming and shortest-paths algorithms over general semirings, object-oriented programming, lazy evaluation and memoization.
