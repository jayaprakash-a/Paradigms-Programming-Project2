Quintessential Quiz Questions
 Mastermind, Weekend Millionairs, Een tegen Honderd: they are successful quizzes that captivate television audiences in many countries.  The idea is well known: contestants are to answer a number of short questions that have short, straightforward answers.  The contestant who answers the most questions correctly wins a large cash prize -- or eternal fame.  Answering quiz-type questions -- also called factoid questions -- is the current goal of the AI branch called question answering.  Previous questions-answering research relied on explicit domain knowledge, which resulted in systems that only worked for specialized domains.  With the advent of large document repositories, and especially the Web, a new approach has become possible: exploiting the redundancy that is present in all the documents, using shallow lexical techniques such as stemming and pattern matching.  The result is open-domain question answering.  Quite a few groups are tackling question answering for the English language, as the 34 participants of the question-answering track at the Text Retrieval conference 2003 showed.  For other languages, including Dutch, there is less research activity.  Last summer there was only one participant of the pilot question-answering track at CLEF, the European information-retrieval conference.  This participant was the Quartz system, built by ILLC at the Universiteit van Amsterdam.  Quartz comes in two flavours: Quartz-d for Dutch and Quartz-e for English question answering.  Below some typical questions and answers are shown for Quartz-e.  Quartz provides a list of possible answers, ranked by confidence or no answer if the confidence is too low.
