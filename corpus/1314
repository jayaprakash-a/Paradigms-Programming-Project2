Embedded Face and Facial Expression Recognition
 Abstract A framework for embedded recognition of faces and facial expressions is described.  Faces are modeled based on the appearances and positions of facial features.  Hidden states are used to represent discrete facial expressions.  A face model is constructed for each person in the database using video segments showing di#erent facial expressions.  Face recognition and facial expression recognition are carried out using Bayesian classification.  In our current implementation, the face is divided into 9 facial features grouped in 4 regions which are detected and tracked automatically in video segments.  We report results on face and facial expression recognition using a video database of 18 people and 6 expressions.
