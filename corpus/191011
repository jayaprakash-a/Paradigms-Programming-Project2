Storing automatically generated treebanks in lattices of derivations
 Abstract Building treebanks { syntactically annotated corpora { is an expensive and time-consuming enterprise.  One alternative to manual annotation is automatic annotation, i. e.  parsing, of new text.  For reasons of accuracy, as well as the demands of certain training methods, it can be important to have a set of weighted alternatives, rather than just one.  In this paper, we propose a format for storing multiple weighted trees.  The basic idea is to represent the set of candidate trees as a tree of derivation choices.  A tree of derivations can be represented as a deterministic weighted finite-state automaton, and existing minimization techniques can be used to exploit shared structure among already split derivations to produce a lattice of trees.  We present empirical trials on an automatically generated treebank for approximately two million words of newspaper text.  We examine in detail the amount of shared structure that such an approach can exploit.
