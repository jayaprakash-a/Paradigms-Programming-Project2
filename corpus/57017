Game-theoretic versions of Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers
 Abstract We prove two variants of Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers in a completely worst-case framework, eschewing any probabilistic assumptions.  The first variant is an assertion about a game involving the Bookmaker predicting the values of unprobabilized random variables; in an intuitive sense it is much stronger than the usual strong law of large numbers for martingales.  The second variant is an assertion about a security market.  The final version of this paper was prepared for the seminar on the foundations of probability (Aalborg University, June 1995) organized by Steffen Lauritzen.  Predictive strong law of large numbers 1 1 Predictive strong law of large numbers In this section we consider the following perfect-information game between 3 players, the Bookmaker, the Statistician, and the Nature.  The game proceeds in trials.  At each trial i, i = 1; 2; : : :, the Bookmaker tries to predict the real number X i the Nature is to produce at the end of the trial.  His prediction consists of two numbers, E i and D i 0; roughly, E i is the Bookmaker's expectation of X i , and D i is his expectation of the accuracy L i := (X i \Gamma E i ) 2 (measured by the Brier scoring rule, see Dawid [1]) of the prediction E i .  Along the lines of Chapter 3 of de Finetti [2] we give an operative interpretation to the numbers E i and D i as follows.  Before X i is disclosed, the Bookmaker lets the Statistician buy any amount, positive or negative, of X i -tickets for $E i each and L i -tickets for $D i each.  An X i -ticket (resp.  L i -ticket) is a contract which obliges the Bookmaker to pay the Statistician $X i (resp.  $(X i \Gamma E i ) 2 ) after X i is disclosed.  We will use the notation e i and d i for the number of X i -tickets and L i -tickets, respectively, bought by the Statistician at trial i.  We describe the unfolding of the game, including the evolution of the Statistician's capital K i , as follows: FOR i = 1; 2; : : :: Bookmaker selects E i 2 IR and D i 0 Statistician selects e i ; d i 2 IR K i := K i\Gamma 1 \Gamma e i E i \Gamma d i D i (1) Nature selects X i 2 IR K i := K i + e i X i + d i (X i \Gamma E i ) 2 .  (2) Initially, the Statistician's capital is K 0 := 1.  We call the pair (e i ; d i ) the portfolio held by the Statistician at trial i.  Equation (1) shows how the Statistician's capital decreases when he buys the new portfolio and (2) describes the proceeds from holding the portfolio.  We can summarize (1) and (2) as follows: K i := K i\Gamma 1 + e i (X i \Gamma E i ) + d i i (X i \Gamma E i ) 2 \Gamma D i j : (3) An important difference between our framework and de Finetti's is that de Finetti assumes that the Bookmaker can directly price any ticket of interest, and we try to minimize the quantity of tickets priced by the Bookmaker.  In particular, for discussing Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers it suffices to assume that the Bookmaker can price only the X i -tickets and L i -tickets.  To complete the description of our game, which will be denoted by G, it remains to specify the rule for determining who won the game given its path E 1 D 1 e 1 d 1 X 1 E 2 D 2 e 2 d 2 X 2 : : : : (4) We say that this path satisfies SLLN if lim n!1 1 n n X i=1 (X i \Gamma E i ) = 0: (5)
