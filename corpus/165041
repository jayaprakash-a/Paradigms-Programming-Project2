TRANSCRIPTION OF BROADCAST NEWS - SOME RECENT IMPROVEMENTS TO IBM'S LVCSR SYSTEM
 ABSTRACT This paper describes extensions and improvements to IBM's large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system for transcription of broadcast news.  The recognizer uses an additional 35 hours of training data over the one used in the 1996 Hub4 evaluation [?].  It includes a number of new features: optimal feature space for acoustic modeling (in training and/or testing), filler-word modeling, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) based segment clustering, an improved implementation of iterative MLLR and 4-gram language models.  Results using the 1996 DARPA Hub4 evaluation data set are presented.
