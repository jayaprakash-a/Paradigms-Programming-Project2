Cortical Columns
 Definition In many regions of the cortex, neuronal response properties remain relatively constant as one moves perpendicular to the surface of the cortex, while they vary in a direction parallel to the cortex.  Such columnar organization is particularly evident in the visual system, in the form of ocular dominance and orientation columns.
