On Exploiting the Oriented Epipolar Constraint in Epipolar Geometry Estimation via RANSAC
 Abstract The efficiency of epipolar geometry estimation by RANSAC is improved by exploiting the oriented epipolar constraint.  Performance evaluation shows that the enhancement leads up to a two-fold speed-up.  The orientation test is trivial to implement, is universally applicable and takes negligible fraction of time compared to epipolar geometry computation.
