Missing and Noisy Data in Nonlinear Time-Series Prediction
 Abstract We discuss the issue of missing and noisy data in nonlinear time-series prediction.  We derive fundamental equations both for prediction and for training.  Our discussion shows that if measurements are noisy or missing, treating the time series as a static input/output mapping problem (the usual time-delay neural network approach) is suboptimal.  We describe approximations of the solutions which are based on stochastic simulations.  A special case is K-step prediction in which a onestep predictor is iterated K times.  Our solutions provide error bars for prediction with missing or noisy data and for K-step prediction.  Using the K-step iterated logistic map as an example, we show that the proposed solutions are a considerable improvement over simple heuristic solutions.  Using our formalism we derive algorithms for training recurrent networks, for control of stochastic systems and for reinforcement learning problems.
