On the Computational Complexity of Networks of Spiking Neurons (Extended Abstract)
 Abstract We investigate the computational power of a formal model for networks of spiking neurons.  It is shown that simple operations on phasedifferences between spike-trains provide a very powerful computational tool that can in principle be used to carry out highly complex computations on a small network of spiking neurons.  We construct networks of spiking neurons that simulate arbitrary threshold circuits, Turing machines, and a certain type of random access machines with real valued inputs.  We also show that relatively weak basic assumptions about the response- and threshold-functions of the spiking neurons are sufficient in order to employ them for such computations.  Furthermore we prove upper bounds for the computational power of networks of spiking neurons with arbitrary piecewise linear response- and threshold-functions, and show that they are with regard to real-time simulations computationally equivalent to a certain type of random access machine, and to recurrent analog neural nets with piecewise linear activation functions.  In addition we give corresponding results for networks of spiking neurons with a limited timing precision, and we prove upper and lower bounds for the VC-dimension and pseudo-dimension of networks of spiking neurons.
