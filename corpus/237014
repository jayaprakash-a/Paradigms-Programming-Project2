A SEGMENT-BASED PROBABILISTIC GENERATIVE MODEL OF SPEECH
 ABSTRACT We present a purely time domain approach to speech processing which identifies waveform samples at the boundaries between glottal pulse periods (in voiced speech) or at the boundaries of unvoiced segments.  An efficient algorithm for inferring these boundaries and estimating the average spectra of voiced and unvoiced regions is derived from a simple probabilistic generative model.  Competitive results are presented on pitch tracking, voiced/unvoiced detection and timescale modification; all these tasks and several others can be performed using the single segmentation provided by inference in the model.
