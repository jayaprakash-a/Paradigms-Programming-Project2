CONTENT-BASED RETRIEVAL FROM IMAGE DATABASES: CURRENT SOLUTIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
 ABSTRACT We review recent advances in image retrieval.  The two fundamental components of a retrieval system, representation and learning, are analyzed.  Each component is decomposed into its constituent building blocks: features, feature representation, and similarity function for the representation; short- and long-term procedures for learning.  We identify a series of requirements for each of the sub-areas, e. g.  optimality, invariance, perceptual relevance, computational tractability, and point out various approaches proposed to satisfy them.  Several open problems are also identified.
