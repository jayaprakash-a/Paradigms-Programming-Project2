Multimodal people ID for a multimedia meeting browser
 ABSTRACT A meeting browser is a system that allows users to review a multimedia meeting record from a variety of indexing methods.  Identification of meeting participants is essential for creating such a multimedia meeting record.  Moreover, knowing who is speaking can enhance the performance of speech recognition and indexing meeting transcription.  In this paper, we present an approach that identifies meeting participants by fusing multimodal inputs.  We use face ID, speaker ID, color appearance ID, and sound source directional ID to identify and track meeting.  After describing the different modules in detail, we will discuss a framework for combining the information sources.  Integration of the multimodal people ID into the multimedia meeting browser is in its preliminary stage.
