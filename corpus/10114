Rotation Invariant Texture Recognition Using a Steerable Pyramid
 Abstract A rotation-invariant texture recognition system is presented.  A steerable oriented pyramid is used to extract representative features for the input textures.  The steerability of the filter set allows a shift to an invariant representation via aDFT-encoding step.  Supervised classification follows.  State-of-the-art recognition results are presented on a 30 texture database with a comparison across the performance of the K-nn, Back-Propagation and Rule-Based classifiers.  In addition, high accuracy estimation of the input rotation angle is demonstrated.
