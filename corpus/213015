 Abstract The synchronization of neural signals has been proposed as atemporal coding scheme in distributed cortical networks.  Theoretical studies in that direction mainly focused on the synchronization ofcoupled oscillatory subsystems.  In the presentwork weshow that several complex types of synchronization previously described for gradedre- sponse neurons appear similarly also in biologically realistic networks of spiking and compartmental neurons.  This includes synchronized complexspatio-1798 oral behavior, partial and generalized synchronization.  The results suggest a similarly rich spatio- -27 oral behavior in real neural systems and may guide experimental research towards the study of complex modes of synchronization and their neuromod- ulation.
