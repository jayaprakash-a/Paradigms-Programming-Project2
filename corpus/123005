On the Applications of Diffusion Kernels to Text Data
 Abstract Kernel methods, such as Support Vector Machines, have successfully been used for text categorization.  A standard choice of kernel function has been the inner product between the vector-space representation of two documents, in analogy with classical information retrieval (IR) approaches.  In this paper we consider diffusion kernels (Kondor, 2001) and their suitability for text data.  We motivate their use from a graph theoretic framework.  We propose an approach based on alignment for selecting the optimal decay parameter # in these kernels.  We provide experimental results demonstrating that diffusion kernels are attractive choices for modelling text data.
