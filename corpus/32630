On-line Scheduling with Hard Deadlines \Lambda
 Abstract We study non-preemptive, online admission control in the hard deadline model: each job must be either serviced prior to its deadline, or be rejected.  Our setting consists of a single resource that services an online sequence of jobs; each job has a length indicating the length of time for which it needs the resource, and a delay indicating the maximum time it can wait for the service to be started.  The goal is to maximize total resource utilization.  The jobs are non-preemptive and exclusive, meaning once a job begins, it runs to completion, and at most one job can use the resource at any time.  We obtain a series of results, under varying assumptions of job lengths and delays, which are summarized in the following table.
