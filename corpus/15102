ICONDENSATION: Unifying Low-Level and High-Level Tracking in a Stochastic Framework
 Abstract.  Tracking research has diverged into two camps; low-level approaches which are typically fast and robust but provide little fine-scale information, and high-level approaches which track complex deformations in high-dimensional spaces but must trade off speed against robustness.  Real-time high-level systems perform poorly in clutter and initialisation for most high-level systems is either performed manually or by a separate module.  This paper presents a new technique to combine low- and high-level information in a consistent probabilistic framework, using the statistical technique of importance sampling combined with the Condensation algorithm.  The general framework, which we term Icondensation, is described, and a hand tracker is demonstrated which combines colour blob-tracking with a contour model.  The resulting tracker is robust to rapid motion, heavy clutter and hand-coloured distractors, and re-initialises automatically.  The system runs comfortably in real time on an entry-level desktop workstation.
