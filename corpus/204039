Hybrid Sort-First and Sort-Last Parallel Rendering with a Cluster of PCs
 Abstract We investigate a new hybrid of sort-first and sort-last approach for parallel polygon rendering, using as a target platform a cluster of PCs.  Unlike previous methods that statically partition the 3D model and/or the 2D image, our approach performs dynamic, viewdependent and coordinated partitioning of both the 3D model and the 2D image.  Using a specific algorithm that follows this approach, we show that it performs better than previous approaches and scales better with both processor count and screen resolution.  Overall, our algorithm is able to achieve interactive frame rates with efficiencies of 55. 0% to 70. 5% during simulations of a system with 64 PCs.
