Combining Two Fast-Learning Real-Time Search Algorithms Yields Even Faster Learning
 Abstract.  Real-time search methods, such as LRTA*, have been used to solve a wide variety of planning problems because they can make decisions fast and still converge to a minimum-cost plan if they solve the same planning task repeatedly.  In this paper, we perform an empirical evaluation of two existing variants of LRTA* that were developed to speed up its convergence, namely HLRTA* and FALCONS.  Our experimental results demonstrate that these two real-time search methods have complementary strengths and can be combined.  We call the new real-time search method eFALCONS and show that it converges with fewer actions to a minimum-cost plan than LRTA*, HLRTA*, and FALCONS.
