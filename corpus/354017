On Randomized Network Coding
 Abstract We consider a randomized network coding approach for multicasting from several sources over a network, in which nodes independently and randomly select linear mappings from inputs onto output links over some field.  This approach was first described in [3], which gave, for acyclic delay-free networks, a bound on error probability, in terms of the number of receivers and random coding output links, that decreases exponentially with code length.  The proof was based on a result in [2] relating algebraic network coding to network flows.  In this paper, we generalize these results to networks with cycles and delay.  We also show, for any given acyclic network, a tighter bound in terms of the probability of connection feasibility in a related network problem with unreliable links.  From this we obtain a success probability bound for randomized network coding in link-redundant networks with unreliable links, in terms of link failure probability and amount of redundancy.
