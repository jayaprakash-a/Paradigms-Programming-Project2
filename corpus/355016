TOWARDS A UNIVERSAL SPEECH INTERFACE
 ABSTRACT We discuss our ongoing attempt to design and evaluate universal human-machine speech-based interfaces.  We describe one such initial design suitable for database retrieval applications, and discuss its implementation in a movie information application prototype.  Initial user studies provided encouraging results regarding the usability of the design, as well as suggest some questions for further investigation.
