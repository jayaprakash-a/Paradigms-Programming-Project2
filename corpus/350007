Learning Distance Functions with Product Space Boosting
 Abstract A good distance function is an essential tool in applications which involve querying large databases, such as image retrieval and bioinformatics.  We describe a non-parametric algorithm for distance function learning which is based on the boosting of low grade weak learners in a product space.  The algorithm learns a function defined over pairs of points, using supervision in the form of equivalence constraints.  The weak learners are based on partitioning the original feature space, using a generic density estimation generative model (GMM) augmented by equivalence constraints on pairs of datapoints.  Using a number of databases from the UCI repository, we show significantly improved results over methods which learn the parametric Mahalanobis distance.  We also show initial results of image retrieval, using a large database of facial images (YaleB).
