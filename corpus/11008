A Probabilistic Framework for the Detection and Tracking in Time of Multiple Sclerosis Lesions
 ABSTRACT A novel statistical scheme for the automatic detection and tracking in time of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in image sequences is described.  Coherent space-time regions in a four-dimensional feature space (intensity, position (x,y), and time) are extracted by unsupervised clustering using Gaussian mixture modeling.  The segments in the sequence pertaining to lesions are automatically detected by context-based classification mechanisms.  Lesion segmentation and tracking are performed in a unified manner and not separately, as in other works.  A model adaptation stage, in which spacetime regions are merged, is introduced for the improvement of lesions' delineation.  Qualitative and quantitative results for a sequence of 24 images are shown.  The framework's results were validated by comparison to an expert's manual delineation.
