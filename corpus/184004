Automated WYWIWYG Design of Both the Topology and Component Values of Electrical Circuits Using Genetic Programming
 ABSTRACT This paper describes an automated process for designing electrical circuits in which "What You Want Is What You Get" ("WYWIWYG" -- pronounced "wow-eee-wig").  The design process uses genetic programming to produce both the topology of the desired circuit and the sizing (numerical values) for all the components of a circuit.  Genetic programming successfully evolves both the topology and the sizing for an asymmetric bandpass filter that was described as being difficult-to-design in a leading electrical engineering journal.  This evolved circuit is another instance in which a genetically evolved solution to a non-trivial problem is competitive with human performance.
