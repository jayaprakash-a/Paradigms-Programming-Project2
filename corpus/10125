Motion from Points, Lines and P-Lines on N views
 Abstract We study the problem of 3D motion analysis based on points and lines correspondence across any number of images.  An intuitive geometric approach is provided, leading to precise algebraic relations.  We reach the statement that on N views, one point and one line correspondences respectively provide 2N \Gamma 3 and 2N \Gamma 4 independent constraints and show how those constraints can be effectively constructed.  In the specific case of points on three views, we derive in a consistent fashion both bilinear and trilinear constraints, and show that there are exactly 3 independent equations per point correspondence.  We illustrate the influence of the choice of constraints through two specific degenerate cases for three views.  Finally, as an extension to points and lines, we derive the motion constraints for a new type of hybrid feature that we call P-Line defined to be a line going through a point in space.  This work is mostly inspired from Hartley's work on lines and points in three views, with a complete geometric interpretation.  The algebraic formalism is in part inspired by Faugeras and provides an intuitive geometric understanding of lines and points on multiple views.
