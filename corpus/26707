Log-concavity results on Gaussian process methods for supervised and unsupervised learning
 Abstract Log-concavity is an important property in the context of optimization, Laplace approximation, and sampling; Gaussian process methods have become quite popular recently for classification, regression, density estimation, and point process intensity estimation.  Here we prove that the predictive densities corresponding to each of these applications are logconcave, given any observed data.  We also prove that the likelihood is log-concave in the hyperparameters controlling the mean function of the Gaussian prior in the density and point process intensity estimation cases, and the mean, covariance, and observation noise parameters in the classification and regression cases; the proof leads to a useful parameterization of these hyperparameters, indicating a suitably large class of priors for which the corresponding maximum a posteriori problem is log-concave.  Finally, we discuss a modification of the Gaussian process idea which leads to the log-concavity property in somewhat more generality for the density and point process estimation cases.
