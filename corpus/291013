Estimating smooth deformation models of substance and noise
 Abstract By representing image prototypes, or "substance", by linear subspaces spanned by deformation fields derived from low-frequecy wavelets, impressive invariance to distortion can be built into generative probability models.  The prototypes representing substance and the distribution over wavelet coefficients can be estimated using EM, since exact inference is tractable in this model.  While this approach works for noise-free data, it is prone to errors for noisy data, where the noise is deformed and then confused with the prototypes representing substance.  We describe a generative model for smooth, nonuniform deformations, in which noise fields are deformed along with the prototypes representing substance.  This prevents deformed substance from being confused with deformed noise.  We show that a variational technique can be used for inference and parameter estimation in this model.  We give results on a very difficult, contrived problem and on facial expression modeling.
