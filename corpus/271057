Object Consolodation by Graph Partitioning with a Conditionally-Trained Distance Metric
 ABSTRACT Coreference analysis, also known as record linkage, object consolidation or identity uncertainty, is a difficult and important problem in natural language processing, databases, citation matching and many other tasks.  This paper introduces several discriminative, conditional-probability models for coreference analysis, all examples of undirected graphical models.  Unlike many historical approaches to coreference, the models presented here are relational---they do not assume that pairwise coreference decisions should be made independently from each other.  Unlike other relational models of coreference that are generative, the conditional model here can incorporate a great variety of features of the input without having to be concerned about their dependencies--paralleling the advantages of conditional random fields over hidden Markov models.  We present positive results on noun coreference in two standard text data sets.
