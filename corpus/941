Evaluating Automatic Summaries of Meeting Recordings
 Abstract The research below explores schemes for evaluating automatic summaries of business meetings, using the ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al. , 2003).  Both automatic and subjective evaluations were carried out, with a central interest being whether or not the two types of evaluations correlate with each other.  The evaluation metrics were used to compare and contrast differing approaches to automatic summarization, the deterioration of summary quality on ASR output versus manual transcripts, and to determine whether manual extracts are rated significantly higher than automatic extracts.
