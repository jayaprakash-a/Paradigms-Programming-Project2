Accelerating Exact k- 2911 Algorithms with Geometric Reasoning
 Abstract We present new algorithms for the k- 3391 clustering problem.  They use the kd-d 22 data structure to reduce the large number of nearest-33594 bor queries issued by the traditional algorithm.  Sufficient statistics are stored in the nodes of the kd-d 343 Then, an analysis of the geometry of the current cluster centers results in great reduction of the work needed to update the centers.  Our algorithms behave exactly as the traditional k- 2743 algorithm.  Proofs of correctness are included.  The kd-d 24 can also be used to initialize the k- 4370 starting centers efficiently.  Our algorithms can be easily extended to provide fast ways of computing the error of a given cluster assignment, regardless of the method in which those clusters were obtained.  We also showhow to use them in a setting whichallows approximate clustering results, with the benefit of running faster.  Wehave implemented and tested our algorithms on both real and simulated data.  Results show a speedup factor of up to 170 on real astrophysical data, and superiorityover the naive algorithm onsimulated data in up to 5 dimensions.  Our algorithms scale well with respect to the number of points and number of centers, allowing for clustering with tens of thousands of centers.
