AV16
3: An Audio-Visual Corpus for Speaker Localization and Tracking.  Abstract.  Assessing the quality of a speaker localization or tracking algorithm on a few short examples is difficult, especially when the groundtruth is absent or not well defined.  One step towards systematic performance evaluation of such algorithms is to provide time-continuous speaker location annotation over a series of real recordings, covering various test cases.  Areas of interest include audio, video and audio-visual speaker localization and tracking.  The desired location annotation can be either 2-dimensional (image plane) or 3-dimensional (physical space).  This paper motivates and describes a corpus of audio-visual data called "AV16. 3", along with a method for 3-D location annotation based on calibrated cameras.  "16. 3" stands for 16 microphones and 3 cameras, recorded in a fully synchronized manner, in a meeting room.  Part of this corpus has already been successfully used to report research results.
