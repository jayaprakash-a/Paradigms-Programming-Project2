Using a Brain-Computer Interface in Highly-Immersive Virtual Reality
 Abstract--- We are in the early stages of investigating the usage of a brain-computer interface in a CAVE-like virtual-reality environment.  Our goal is to evaluate how people respond to such an interface, and how their response is related to their sense of presence in the virtual environment.  In this presentation we will describe the system we are using and the motivation for this research.
