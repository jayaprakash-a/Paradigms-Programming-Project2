Learning Binary Relations and Total Orders
 Abstract We study the problem of learning a binary relation between two sets of objects or between a set and itself.  We represent a binary relation between a set of size n and a set of size m as an n \Theta m matrix of bits, whose (i# j)entry is 1 if and only if the relation holds between the corresponding elements of the twosets.  We present polynomial prediction algorithms for learning binary relations in an extended on-line learning model, where the examples are drawn by the learner, by a helpful teacher, by an adversary, or according to a uniform probability distribution on the instance space.  In the first part of this paper, we present results for the case that the matrix of the relation has at most k rowtypes.  We present upper and lower bounds on the number of prediction mistakes any prediction algorithm makes when learning such a matrix under the extended on-line learning model.  Furthermore, we describe a technique that simplifies the proof of expected mistake bounds against a randomly chosen query sequence.  In the second part of this paper, we consider the problem of learning a binary relation that is a total order on a set.  We describe a general technique using a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (fpras) to implement a randomized version of the halving algorithm.  We apply this technique to the problem of learning a total order, using a fpras for counting the number of extensions of a partial order,
