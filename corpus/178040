BLIND SEPARATION OF LINEAR CONVOLUTIVE MIXTURES USING ORTHOGONAL FILTER BANKS
 ABSTRACT We propose an algorithm and architecture for real-time blind source separation of linear convolutive mixtures using orthogonal filter banks.  The adaptive algorithm derives from stochastic gradient descent optimization of a performance metric that quantifies independence not only across the reconstructed sources, but also across time within each source.  The special case of a Laguerre section offers a compact representation with a small number of filter taps even under severe reverberant conditions, facilitating real-time implementation in a modular and scalable parallel architecture.  Simulations of the proposed architecture and update rule validate the approach.
