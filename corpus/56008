A* Parsing: Fast Exact Viterbi Parse Selection
 Abstract We present an extension of the classic A* search procedure to tabular PCFG parsing.  The use of A* search can dramatically reduce the time required to find a best parse by conservatively estimating the probabilities of parse completions.  We discuss various estimates and give efficient algorithms for computing them.  On average-length Penn treebank sentences, our most detailed estimate reduces the total number of edges processed to less than 3% of that required by exhaustive parsing, and a simpler estimate, which requires less than a minute of precomputation, reduces the work to less than 5%.
