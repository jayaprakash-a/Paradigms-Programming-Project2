A Non-Parametric EM-Style Algorithm for Imputing Missing Values
 Abstract We present an iterative non-parametric algorithm for imputing missing values.  The algorithm is similar to EM except that it uses non-parametric models such as k-nearest neighbor or kernel regression instead of the parametric models used with EM.  An interesting feature of the algorithm is that the E and M steps collapse into a single step because the data being filled in is the model -- updating the filled-in values updates the model at the same time.  The main advantages of this approach compared to parametric EM methods are that: 1) it is more efficient for moderate size data sets, and 2) it is less susceptible to errors that parametric methods make when the parametric models do not fit the data well.  The robustness to model failure makes the non-parametric method more accurate when models of the data are not known apriori and cannot be determined reliably.  We evaluate the method using a real medical data set that has many missing values.  1 Motivation The Port Pneumonia Database [2] contains 2287 pneumonia patients.  For our experiments we use 216 of the 1000+ features available in the raw database.  6. 3% of the values of the 216 attributes are missing.  More than 99% of the cases in the database are missing at least one of the 216 values, and one of the 216 attributes is missing in 61% of the cases.  Values in this database may be missing because they were not recorded, because they were not measured, or because they were assumed normal.
