Model-Based Clustering and Visualization of Navigation Patterns on a Web Site
 Abstract We present a new methodology for exploring and analyzing navigation patterns on a web site.  The patterns that can be analyzed consist of sequences of URL categories traversed by users.  In our approach, we first partition site users into clusters such that users with similar navigation paths through the site are placed into the same cluster.  Then, for each cluster, we display these paths for users within that cluster.  The clustering approachweemploy is model-based (as opposed to distance-based) and partitions users according to the order in which they request web pages.  In particular, we cluster users by learning a mixture of first-order Markov models using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.  The runtime of our algorithm scales linearly with the number of clusters and with the size of the data; and our implementation easily handles hundreds of thousands of user sessions in memory.  In the paper, we describe the details of our method and a visualization tool based on it called WebCANVAS.  We illustrate the use of our approach on user-traffic data from msnbc. com.
