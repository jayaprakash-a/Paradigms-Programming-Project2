Classification of Faces in Man and Machine
 Abstract We attempt to shed light on the algorithms used by humans to classify images of human faces according to their gender.  For this, a novel methodology combining human psychophysics and machine learning is introduced.  We proceed as follows.  In a first stage, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the pixel information of the face stimuli.  We then obtain a dataset composed of these PCA-eigenvectors combined with the subjects' gender estimates of the corresponding stimuli.  In a second stage we model the gender classification process on this dataset using a separating hyperplane (SH)
