The BANCA Database and Experimental Protocol for Speaker Verification
 Abstract.  Identity verification has become a very important research topic recently, particularly using methods based on the face or the voice of the individuals.  In the context of the BANCA european project, a novel multi-modal database was recently recorded, spanning 5 european languages, 2 modalities (face and voice), 2 microphones, 2 cameras and almost 300 individuals.  As we believe that this database offers many advantages for this research community, this paper essentially presents the database and its associated experimental protocol, as well as a baseline state-of-the-art system using the voice data for a text-independent speaker verification task.
