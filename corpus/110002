Image Enhancement By Nonlinear Extrapolation in Frequency Space
 Abstract---A technique for enhancing the perceptual sharpness of an image is described.  The enhancement algorithm augments the frequency content of the image using shape-invariant properties of edges across scale by using a nonlinearity that generates phasecoherent higher harmonics.  The procedure utilizes the Laplacian transform and the Laplacian pyramid image representation.  Results are presented depicting the power-spectra augmentation and the visual enhancement of several images.  Simplicity of computations and ease of implementation allow for real-time applications such as high-definition television (HDTV).
