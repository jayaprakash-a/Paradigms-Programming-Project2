Wrapper Induction for End-User Semantic Content Development
 ABSTRACT The transition from existing World Wide Web content to the Semantic Web relies on the labeling and classification of existing information before it is useful to end-users and their agents.  This paper presents a wrapper induction system designed to allow end-users to create, modify, and utilize semantic patterns on unlabeled World Wide Web documents.  These patterns allow users to overlay documents with RDF classes and properties, and then to interact with this labeled content within a larger Semantic Web application, such as Haystack.
