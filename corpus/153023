Self-organization and nonparametric regression
 Abstract We describe a framework for self-organization which relates the formation of topologic maps to minimization of a free energy function.  In the zero noise limit the resulting on-line learning rule is similar to the Kohonen learning rule.  We derive a fast EM-algorithm for finite training sets.  Choosing different noise parameters for input and output variables we obtain an algorithm for knot placement in nonparametric regression.  This algorithm naturally fits into projection pursuit regression when we treat the noise parameter as a projection vector.
