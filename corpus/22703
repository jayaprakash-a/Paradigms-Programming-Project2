The CMS Tracker front-end and control electronics in an LHC like beam test
 Abstract A complete prototype of the CMS tracker read-out and control system has been built using components as close as possible to the final design.  It is based on an amplifier and analogue pipeline memory chip (APV), analogue optical links transmitting at 40Ms/s and a VME mounted digitisation and data handling board (FED-PMC), supplemented by a control architecture based on FECs which set and monitor the components of the entire system.  This system has been successfully operated for the first time under LHC like beam conditions in a 25ns structured beam provided by the SPS at CERN.  The objective was primarily to test the synchronisation and pile-up effects in a high trigger rate environment and to examine the many issues involved in operating a complete readout and control system.
