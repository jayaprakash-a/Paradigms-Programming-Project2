Calculation of the Learning Curve of Bayes Optimal Classification Algorithm for Learning a Perceptron With Noise
 Abstract The learning curve of Bayes optimal classification algorithm when learning a perceptron from noisy random training examples is calculated exactly in the limit of large training sample size and large instance space dimension using methods of statistical mechanics.  It is shown that under certain assumptions, in this "thermodynamic" limit, the probability of misclassification of Bayes optimal algorithm is less than that of a canonical stochastic learning algorithm, by a factor approaching ing p 2 as the ratio of number of training examples to instance space dimension grows.  Exact asymptotic learning curves for both algorithms are derived for particular distributions.  In addition, it is shown that the learning performance of Bayes optimal algorithm can be approximated by certain learning algorithms that use a neural net with a layer of hidden units to learn a perceptron.
