Computer Science Technical Report Robust Reinforcement Learning Control with Static and Dynamic Stability
 Abstract Robust control theory is used to design stable controllers in the presence of uncertainties.  By replacing nonlinear and time-varying aspects of a neural network with uncertainties, a robust reinforcement learning procedure results that is guaranteed to remain stable even as the neural network is being trained.  The behavior of this procedure is demonstrated and analyzed on two simple control tasks.  For one task, reinforcement learning with and without robust constraints results in the same control performance, but at intermediate stages the system without robust constraints goes through a period of unstable behavior that is avoided when the robust constraints are included.
