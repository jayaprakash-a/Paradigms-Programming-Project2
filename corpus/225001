Inducing Novel Gene-Drug Interactions from the Biomedical Literature
 ABSTRACT Motivation: Knowledge about the interactions between genes and drugs is important in determining the efficacy and toxicity of medications.  We present a supervised learning algorithm for inducing previously unknown genedrug interactions by text-mining the biomedical literature.  This algorithm takes as its input a set of known genedrug relationships and a literature source.  New genedrug interactions are induced based on similarity to known gene-drug interactions, where similarity is determined according to the biomedical literature.  Results: Based on limited training data (258 genedrug pairs), the algorithm induces correct unseen genedrug relationships at precisions of over 60%, including gene-drug relationships that are not obvious from name similarity.
