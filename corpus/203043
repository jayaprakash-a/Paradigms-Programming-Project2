Numerical Investigation of the Spectrum for Certain Families of Cayley Graphs
 Abstract In this paper we extend some earlier computations [8].  In particular, the expanding behavior of Cayley graphs of PSL2 (F107) is compared with that of the Cayley graphs for the group A10 .  These computations support the (up to now) unvoiced conjecture of Lubotzky that the symmetric groups and projective linear groups have asymptotically different average expanding behavior.  We also give a thorough spectral analysis for a natural family of Cayley graphs which does not admit analysis by Selberg's theorem.
