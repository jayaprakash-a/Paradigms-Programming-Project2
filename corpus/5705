PRICING EUROPEAN OPTIONS WITHOUT PROBABILITY
 Abstract It is well known that in the case where the stock price S t is governed by the equation dS t =S t = dt + oedW t , any European option satisfying weak regularity conditions has a fair price (the Black---Scholes formula and its generalizations).  We consider the case where no probabilistic assumptions are made about S t ; instead, we assume that the derivative security D which pays a dividend of (dS t =S t ) 2 (the squared relative increase in the price of S t ) each instant dt is traded in the market.  We prove that the ``regular" European options have fair prices provided that both S t and D t (the price process of D) are continuous and the fractal dimensions of the graphs of S t and D t satisfy certain inequalities.  Intuitively our assumptions are much weaker than the usual assumption dS t =S t = dt + oedW t .
