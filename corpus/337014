Efficient `-Subsumption based on Graph Algorithms
 Abstract.  The `-subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of ILP learning systems.  We discuss two `-subsumption algorithms based on strategies for preselecting suitable matching literals.  The class of clauses, for which subsumption becomes polynomial, is a superset of the deterministic clauses.  We further map the general problem of `-subsumption to a certain problem of finding a clique of fixed size in a graph, and in return show that a specialization of the pruning strategy of the Carraghan and Pardalos clique algorithm provides a dramatic reduction of the subsumption search space.  We also present empirical results for the mesh design data set.
