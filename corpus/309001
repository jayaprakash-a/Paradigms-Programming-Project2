A COUPLED HMM FOR AUDIO-VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION
 ABSTRACT In recent years several speech recognition systems that use visual together with audio information showed significant increase in performance over the standard speech recognition systems.  The use of visual features is justified by both the bimodality of the speech generation and by the need of features that are invariant to acoustic noise perturbation.  The audio-visual speech recognition system presented in this paper introduces a novel audio-visual fusion technique that uses a coupled hidden Markov model (HMM).  The statistical properties of the coupled-HMM allow us to model the state asynchrony of the audio and visual observations sequences while still preserving their natural correlation over time.  The experimental results show that the coupled HMM outperforms the multistream HMM in audio visual speech recognition.
