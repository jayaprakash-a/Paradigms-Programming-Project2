Extractive Summarization of Meeting Recordings
 Abstract Several approaches to automatic speech summarization are discussed below, using the ICSI Meetings corpus.  We contrast feature-based approaches using prosodic and lexical features with maximal marginal relevance and latent semantic analysis approaches to summarization.  While the latter two techniques are borrowed directly from the field of text summarization, feature-based approaches using prosodic information are able to utilize characteristics unique to speech data.  We also investigate how the summarization results might deteriorate when carried out on ASR output as opposed to manual transcripts.  All of the summaries are of an extractive variety, and are compared using the software ROUGE.
