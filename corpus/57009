Pattern Recognition and Density Estimation under the General i
i. d.  Assumption.  Abstract Statistical learning theory considers three main problems, pattern recognition, regression and density estimation.  When analyzing learning algorithms, the usual assumption made is that the data is generated by an i. i. d.  source; sometimes, however, extra assumptions are also made.  This paper studies solvability of these three main problems (mainly concentrating on pattern recognition and density estimation) in the "highdimensional" case, where the patterns in the training and test sets are never repeated.  We show that, assuming an i. i. d.  data source but without any further assumptions, the problems of pattern recognition and regression can often be solved (and there are practically useful algorithms to solve them).  On the other hand, the problem of density estimation, as we formalize it, cannot be solved under the general i. i. d.  assumption, and additional assumptions are required.
