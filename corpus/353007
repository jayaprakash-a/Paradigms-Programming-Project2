Molecular classification of multiple tumor types
 ABSTRACT Using gene expression data to classify tumor types is a very promising tool in cancer diagnosis.  Previous works show several pairs of tumor types can be successfully distinguished by their gene expression patterns (Golub et al.  (1999), Ben-Dor et al.  (2000), Alizadeh et al.  (2000)).  However, the simultaneous classification across a heterogeneous set of tumor types has not been well studied yet.  We obtained 190 samples from 14 tumor classes and generated a combined expression dataset containing 16063 genes for each of those samples.  We performed multi-class classification by combining the outputs of binary classifiers.  Three binary classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, weighted voting, and support vector machines) were applied in conjunction with three combination scenarios (one-vs-all, all-pairs, hierarchical partitioning).  We achieved the best cross validation error rate of 18. 75% and the best test error rate of 21. 74% by using the one-vs-all support vector machine algorithm.  The results demonstrate the feasibility of performing clinically useful classification from samples of multiple tumor types.
