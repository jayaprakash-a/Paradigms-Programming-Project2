Neuromorphic Analog VLSI Sensor for Visual Tracking: Circuits and Application Examples
 Abstract---This paper presents a one-dimensional visual sensor, implemented on a single VLSI chip using analog neuromorphic circuits, for selectively detecting and tracking the position of the feature with the highest spatial contrast present in the visual scene.  The chip's photoreceptors adapt to stationary backgrounds and can be tuned to respond maximally to specific target velocities.  The sensor drastically reduces the amount of data to be transmitted to further processing stages by encoding, in real time, the position of the target in the form of a single continuous-time analog variable.  We describe the circuits implementing the sensor and show applications to three examples of tracking tasks: a stand-alone visual tracking system, an active fully analog tracking system, and a mobile platform line-following system.
