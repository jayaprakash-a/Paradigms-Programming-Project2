Computer Science Technical Report Introduction to Computational Neural Modeling for Computer Scientists and Mathematicians
 Abstract The rise in availability of powerful personal computers allows researchers in many dierent disciplines access to problems that were, in the recent past, computationally intractable.  Biologically realistic neural models are one example of a problem that is both computationally expensive, but also multidisciplinary by nature.  These neural models incorporate fundamental neuroscience principles into a mathematical framework that may be understood and studied by experts in computer science and mathematics.  Moreover, the inclusion of these disciplines into neural modeling research is essential as the models grow larger, more detailed, and hence more complicated in both construction and analysis.  Neural modeling demands collaboration among widely diering scientific disciplines and thus, demands an easily accessible introduction to researchers grounded in the mathematical sciences.  This introduction attempts to simply and succinctly introduce the basic biological, chemical, and physical science upon which neural models are built.  The introduction then defines, derives, and explains, stepwise, numerical integration of the compartment model using the Backward Euler method.
