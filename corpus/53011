A Hidden Markov Model for de Novo Peptide Sequencing
 Abstract De novo Sequencing of peptides is a challenging task in proteome research.  While there exist reliable DNA-sequencing methods, the highthroughput de novo sequencing of proteins by mass spectrometry is still an open problem.  Current approaches suffer from a lack in precision to detect mass peaks in the spectrograms.  In this paper we present a novel method for de novo peptide sequencing based on a hidden Markov model.  Experiments effectively demonstrate that this new method significantly outperforms standard approaches in matching quality.
