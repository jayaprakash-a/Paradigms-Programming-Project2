Sensor Planning with Non-linear Utility Functions
 Abstract.  Sensor planning is concerned with when to sense and what to sense.  We study sensor planning in the context of planning objectives that trade-off between minimizing the worst-case, expected, and best-case planexecution costs.  Sensor planning with these planning objectives is interesting because they are realistic and the frequency of sensing changes with the planning objective: more pessimistic decision makers tend to sense more frequently.  We perform sensor planning by combining one of our techniques for planning with non-linear utility functions with an existing sensor-planning method.  The resulting sensor-planning method is not only as easy to implement as the sensor-planning method that it extends but also (almost) as efficient.  We demonstrate empirically how sensor plans change as the planning objective changes, using a common testbed for sensor planning.
