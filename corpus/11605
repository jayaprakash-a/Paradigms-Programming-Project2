Smart Visible Sets for Networked Virtual Environments
 Abstract - The real-time visualization of complex virtual environments across the network is a challenging problem in Computer Graphics.  The use of pre-computed visibility associated to regions in space, such as in the Potentially Visible Sets (PVS) approach, may reduce the amount of data sent across the network.  However, a PVS for a region may still be complex, and further partitions of the PVS are necessary.  In this paper we introduce the concept of a Smart Visible Set (SVS), which corresponds to (1) a partition of PVS information into dynamic subsets that take into account client position, and (2) an ordering mechanism that enumerates these dynamic sets using a visual importance metric.  Results comparing the SVS and the PVS approach are presented.
