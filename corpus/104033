Machine Learning for Subproblem Selection
 Abstract Subproblem generation, solution, and recombination is a standard approach to combinatorial optimization problems.  In many settings identifying suitable subproblems is itself a significant component of the technique.  Such subproblems are often identified using a heuristic rule.  Here we show how to use machine learning to make this identi#cation.  In particular we use a learned objective function to direct search in an appropriate space of subproblem decompositions.  We demonstrate the ecacy of our technique for problem decomposition on a particular wellknown combinatorial optimization problem, graph coloring for geometric graphs.
