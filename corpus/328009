Learning internal representations in an attractor neural network with analogue neurons
 Abstract A learning attractor neural network (LANN) with a double dynamics of neural activities and synaptic efficacies, operating on two different time scales is studied by simulations in preparation for an electronic implementation.  The present network includes several quasi-realistic features: neurons are represented by their afferent currents and output spike rates; excitatory and inhibitory neurons are separated; attractor spike rates as well as coding levels in arriving stimuli are low; learning takes place only between excitatory units.  Synaptic dynamics is an unsupervised, analog Hebbian process, but long term
