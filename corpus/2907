Targeted Internet Advertising Using Predictive Clustering and Linear Programming
 Abstract Many Internet sites have the freedom to choose which advertisements go on which page, subject to the constraint that all paid-for ads must be shown.  To increase revenue, these sites can choose ads so as to maximize click-through rates.  We present a two-step system that does so.  In step one, the system applies predictive clustering to the pages so that the clusters are good predictors of ad click-through.  This predictive clustering is accomplished by GEM applied to a regularized log loss on click-through prediction.  In step two, the system measures click-through rates of each cluster, and then uses a linear program to optimize overall click-through rate on the site.  Using data from the msnbc. com Internet site, we show that this approach increases overall click-through rate by 38%, a dramatic improvement over the use of hand-assigned clusters.
