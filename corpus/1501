Hierarchical Visualization of Time-Series Data Using Switching Linear Dynamical Systems
 Abstract We propose a novel visualization algorithm for high-dimensional time-series data.  In contrast to most visualization techniques we do not assume consecutive data points to be independent.  The basic model is a linear dynamical system which can be seen as a dynamic extension of a probabilistic principal component model.  A further extension to a particular switching linear dynamical system allows a representation of complex data onto multiple and even a hierarchy of plots.  Using sensible approximations based on expectation propagation the projections can be performed in essentially the same order complexity as its static counterpart.  We apply our method on a real-world data set with sensor readings from a paper machine.
