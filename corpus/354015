Towards using the network as a switch: On the use of TDM in linear optical networks
 Abstract A common problem in optical networking is that the large quantity of raw bandwidth available in such networks is often dicult to access.  We show that time-division multiplexing (TDM) can be used to operate bus and ring architectures in a manner akin to a switch.  We consider a time-varying approach, akin to that used in switching theory, instead of the static approach, related to the knapsack problem, often associated with fixed allocation of trac onto circuits, often termed the grooming problem.  Our approach is probabilistic in nature, and requires significant generalization beyond the Birkho-von Neumann statistical multiplexing approaches have that have been successful in switching theory.  Our techniques rely on decompositions of fractional matchings (for architectures without erasures) and fractional interval graph colorings (for architectures with erasures) into integral matchings and colorings.  We show, moreover, that such TDM using statistical multiplexing substantially reduces the amount of hardware (particularly ADMs) needed to utilize fully the available bandwidth in a range of optical networks.  We show that a significant fraction (and in some cases all) of the bandwidth available to the system can be utilized, even if each node in the system has only a single ADM.
