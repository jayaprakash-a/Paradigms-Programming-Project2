z/x MDMA on cerebral blood flow: a co-registered SPECT and MRI study
 Abstract Z.  3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine MDMA , an illicit recreational drug, damages serotonergic nerve endings.  Since the cerebrovasculature is regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood flow Z.  CBF in humans.  We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI.  Ten of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving Z.  two doses of MDMA.  Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different global or regional CBF rCBF compared to the control subjects.  However, within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal regions compared to baseline rCBF.  The decreased rCBF tended to be more pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA.  Two subjects who were scanned at 2]3 months after MDMA administration showed increased rather than decreased rCBF.
