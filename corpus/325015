The TIGR Gene Indices: analysis of gene transcript sequences in highly sampled eukaryotic species
 ABSTRACT While genome sequencing projects are advancing rapidly, EST sequencing and analysis remains a primary research tool for the identification and categorization of gene sequences in a wide variety of species and an important resource for annotation of genomic sequence.  The TIGR Gene Indices (
