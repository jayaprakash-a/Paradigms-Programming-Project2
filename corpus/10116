Overcomplete Steerable Pyramid Filters and Rotation Invariance
 Abstract A given (overcomplete) discrete oriented pyramid may be converted into a steerable pyramid by interpolation.  We present a technique for deriving the optimal interpolation functions (otherwise called steering coefficients).  The proposed scheme is demonstrated on a computationally efficient oriented pyramid, which is a variation on the Burt and Adelson pyramid.  We apply the generated steerable pyramid to orientation-invarianttexture analysis to demonstrate its excellent rotational isotropy.  High classification rates and precise rotation identification are demonstrated.
