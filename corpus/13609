EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS BY THE SELF-ORGANIZING MAP: STRUCTURES OF WELFARE AND POVERTY IN THE WORLD
 The self-organizing map (SOM) is a method that represents statistical data sets in an ordered fashion, as a natural groundwork on which the distributions of the individual indicators in the set can be displayed and analyzed.  As a case study that instructs how to use the SOM to compare states of economic systems, the standard of living of different countries is analyzed using the SOM.  Based on a great number (39) of welfare indicators the SOM illustrates rather refined relationships between the countries two-dimensionally.  This method is directly applicable to the financial grading of companies, too.
