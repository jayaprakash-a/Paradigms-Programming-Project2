Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering \Lambda
 Abstract Collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like.  In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods.  We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains.  We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics.  The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation.  The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items.  This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list.  Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms.  Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vectorsimilarity methods.  Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions.  Other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.
