Ensemble-based Discriminant Learning with Boosting For Face Recognition
 Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble-based approach to boost performance of traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)-based methods used in face recognition.  The ensemble-based approach is based on the recently emerged technique known as "boosting".  However, it is generally believed that boosting-like learning rules are not suited to a strong and stable learner such as LDA.  To break the limitation, a novel weakness analysis theory is developed here.  The theory attempts to boost a strong learner by increasing the diversity between the classifiers created by the learner, at the expense of decreasing their margins, so as to achieve a trade-off suggested by recent boosting studies for a low generalization error.  In addition, a novel distribution accounting for the pairwise class discriminant information is introduced for effective interaction between the booster and the LDA-based learner.  The integration of all these methodologies proposed here leads to the novel ensemble-based discriminant learning approach, capable of taking advantage of both the boosting and LDA techniques.  Promising experimental results obtained on various difficult face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  We believe that this work is especially beneficial in extending the boosting framework to accommodate general (strong/weak) learners.
