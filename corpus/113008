Data Mining in Metric Space: An Empirical Analysis of Supervised Learning Performance Criteria
 Abstract.  Many criteria can be used to evaluate the performance of supervised learning.  Different criteria are appropriate in different settings, and it is not always clear which criteria to use.  A further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria.  For example, SVMs and boosting are designed to optimize accuracy, whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy.  We conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods (
