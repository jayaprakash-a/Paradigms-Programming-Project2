On Matching Scores for LDA-based Face Verification
 Abstract We address the problem of face verification using linear discriminant analysis and investigate the issue of matching score 1 .  We establish the reason behind the success of the normalised correlation.  The improved understanding about the role of metric then naturally leads to a novel way of measuring the distance between a probe image and a model.  In extensive experimental studies on the publicly available XM2VTS database 2 using the Lausanne protocol 3 we show that the proposed metric is consistently superior to both the Euclidean distance and normalised correlation matching scores.  The effect of various photometric normalisations 4 on the matching scores is also investigated.
