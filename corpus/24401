Non-Gaussian Component Analysis: a Semiparametric Framework for Linear Dimension Reduction
 Abstract We propose a new linear method for dimension reduction to identify nonGaussian components in high dimensional data.  Our method, NGCA (Non-Gaussian Component Analysis), uses a very general semiparametric framework.  In contrast to existing projection methods we define what is uninteresting (Gaussian): by projecting out uninterestingness we can estimate the relevant non-Gaussian subspace.  We show that the estimation error of finding the non-Gaussian components tends to zero at a parametric rate.  Once NGCA components are identified and extracted, various tasks can be applied in the data analysis process, say, data visualization, clustering, denoising or classification.  A numerical study demonstrates the usefulness of our method.
