A Theoretical Analysis of Query Selection for Collaborative Filtering
 Abstract.  We consider the problem of determining which of a set of experts has tastes most similar to a given user by asking the user questions about his likes and dislikes.  We describe a simple algorithm for generating queries for a theoretical model of this problem.  We show that the algorithm requires at most opt(F )(ln(jF j=opt(F )) + 1) + 1 queries to find the correct expert, where opt(F ) is the optimal worst-case bound on the number of queries for learning arbitrary elements of the set of experts F .  The algorithm runs in time polynomial in jF j and jXj (where X is the domain) and we prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can have a significantly better bound on the number of queries unless all problems in NP have n O(log log n) time algorithms.  We also study a more general case where the user ratings come from a finite set Y and there is an integer-valued loss function ` on Y that is used to measure the distance between the ratings.  Assuming that the loss function is a metric and that there is an expert within a distance # from the user, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find such an expert after at most 2opt(F; #) ln jF j 1+deg(F;#) + 2(# + 1)(1 + deg(F; #)) queries, where deg(F; #) is the largest number of experts in F that are within a distance 2# of any f 2 F .
