A Factorization Based Algorithm for Multi-Image Projective Structure and Motion
 Abstract We propose a method for the recovery of projective shape and motion from multiple images of a scene by the factorization of a matrix containing the images of all points in all views.  This factorization is only possible when the image points are correctly scaled.  The major technical contribution of this paper is a practical method for the recovery of these scalings, using only fundamental matrices and epipoles estimated from the image data.  The resulting projective reconstruction algorithm runs quickly and provides accurate reconstructions.  Results are presented for simulated and real images.
