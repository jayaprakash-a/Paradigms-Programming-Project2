Laplacian Eigenmaps for Dimensionality Reduction and Data Representation
 Abstract One of the central problems in machine learning and pattern recognition is to develop appropriate representations for complex data.  We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional space.  Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high dimensional data.  The algorithm provides a computationally ecient approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction that has locality preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering.  Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed.
