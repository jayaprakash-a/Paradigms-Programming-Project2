Overabundance Analysis and Class Discovery in Gene Expression Data \Lambda
 Abstract Recent studies (Alizadeh et al.  2000, Bittner et al.  2000, Golub et al.  1999) demonstrate the discovery of disease subtypes from gene expression data.  In this paper, we propose a principled and systematic approach to address the computational problem of partitioning the set of sample tissues into statistically meaningful classes.  We start by describing a method,
