MODELLING HUMAN CONTROL BEHAVIOUR WITH CONTEXT-DEPENDENT MARKOV-SWITCHING MULTIPLE MODELS
 Abstract: A probabilistic model of human control behaviour is described.  It assumes that human behaviour can be represented by switching among a number of relatively simple behaviours.  The model structure is closely related to the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) commonly used for speech recognition.  An HMM with context-dependent transition functions switching between linear control laws is identified from experimental data.  The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in a pitch control task for a simplified helicopter model.
