Articulated Body Motion Capture by Annealed Particle Filtering
 Abstract The main challenge in articulated body motion tracking is the large number of degrees of freedom (around 30) to be recovered.  Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity.  One approach is to introduce constraints either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions.  Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent.  In contrast, here we aim for general tracking without special preparation of subjects or restrictive assumptions.  The principal contribution of this paper is the development of a modied particle lter for search in high dimensional conguration spaces.  It uses a continuation principle, based on annealing, to introduce the inuence of narrow peaks in the tness function, gradually.  The new algorithm, termed annealed particle ltering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efciently.
