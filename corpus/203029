LEVEL SPACINGS FOR
 Abstract.  We investigate the eigenvalue spacing distributions for randomly generated 4-regular Cayley graphs on SL 2 (Fp ) by numerically calculating their spectra.  We present strong evidence that the distributions are Poisson and hence do not follow the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble.  Among the Cayley graphs of SL 2 (Fp ) we consider are the new expander graphs recently discovered by Y.  Shalom.  In addition, we use a Markov chain method to generate random 4-regular graphs, and observe that the average eigenvalue spacings are closely approximated by the Wigner surmise.
