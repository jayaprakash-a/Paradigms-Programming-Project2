D.  Thesis Proposal.  Study of Reinforcement Learning Methods with Generalization Capabilities.  Abstract My Ph. D.  research will contribute to the area of reinforcement learning (RL) - a framework for learning by computational agents that are situated in a dynamic environment and strive to achieve some long-term performance goals.  In order to be applicable to problems with large state spaces, RL methods have to make use of function approximation (FA) techniques.  However, such a combination appears to be very difficult for theoretical analysis and theoretical results are limited.  Moreover, there is not much practical experience with these systems.  In my thesis, I plan to study the effect of FA and problem characteristics on RL algorithms.  As the first stage of my work, I will conduct a large-scale empirical study of a number of RL methods combined with FA techniques.  This will be the first attempt to date to compare and study the algorithms' performance in an extensive, unified test environment.  I will define attributes characterizing learning problems and develop a collection of benchmark problems based on these attributes.  In the second stage of my work, I will develop algorithms and recommendations to partially automate the design of RL systems by automatic parameter settings and selection of appropriate RL/FA methods based on domain properties.  I will perform an in-depth analysis of the experimental results in order to gain understanding of the various outstanding questions about the properties and relative merits of the algorithms.  The goal is to elucidate the effect of domain and FA dynamics on RL algorithms.  My thesis will contribute to both application and theoretical aspects of RL.
