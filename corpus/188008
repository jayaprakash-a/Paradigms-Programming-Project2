ON TRANSIENT DYNAMICS, OFF-EQUILIBRIUM BEHAVIOUR AND IDENTIFICATION IN BLENDED MULTIPLE MODEL STRUCTURES
 Abstract The use of multiple-model techniques has been reported in a variety of control and signal processing applications.  However, several theoretical analyses have recently appeared which outline fundamental limitations of these techniques in certain domains of application.  In particular, the identifiability and interpretability of local linear model parameters in transient operating regimes is shown to be limited.  Some modifications to the basic paradigm are suggested which overcome a number of the problems.  As an alternative to parametric identification of blended multiple model structures, nonparametric Gaussian process priors are suggested as a means of providing local models, and the results compared to a multiple-model approach in a Monte Carlo simulation on some simulated vehicle dynamics data.  1 The Multiple-Model Framework The past few years have shown an increase in the use of local model representations of non-linear dynamic systems (see (Johansen and Murray-Smith 1997) for a review).  This basic structure includes a number of approaches: Tagaki--Sugeno fuzzy systems (Takagi and Sugeno 1985), local model networks, gain-scheduled control (Leith and Leithead 1999), and statistical mixture models, among them.  The model parameters are obtained from prior knowledge, linearisations of a physical model or identified from measured data.  Advantages of this approach are purported to be its simplicity, the insight into global dynamics obtained from the local models, and the ease with which global control laws can be constructed from local designs.  Consider the nonlinear system x = f (x; u).  By a blended local model structure we understand a dynamic model of the form x = Nm X i=1 ae i (x; u)f i (x; u); (1) where state x 2 IR N , input u 2 IR P , the model f
