MIXED-MODE VLSI IMPLEMENTATION OF FUZZY ART
 ABSTRACT We present an asynchronous mixed analog-digital VLSI architecture which implements the Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (Fuzzy-ART) algorithm.  Both classification and learning are performed on-chip in real-time.  Unique features of our implementation include: an embedded refresh mechanism to overcome memory drift due to charge leakage from volatile capacitive storage; and a recoding mechanism to eliminate and reassign inactive categories.  A small scale ### ### m feature size CMOS prototype with 4 inputs and 8 output categories has been designed and fabricated.  The unit cell which performs the fuzzy min and learning operations measures 100 # m by 45 # m.  Experimental results are included to illustrate performance of the unit cell.
