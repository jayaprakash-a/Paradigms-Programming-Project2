BLIND EQUALIZATION AND DETECTION FOR OFDM SYSTEMS WITH INSUFFICIENT CYCLIC PREFIX
 ABSTRACT In this paper, the problem of equalization and detection for OFDM systems with insufficient cyclic prefix (CP) is considered.  A blind algorithm based on second - order statistics (SOS) is developed to estimate the channel impulse response.  Then this paper explores a method to design the channel-shortening prefilter (CSP), which is used to shorten the channel impulse response to preselected length.  Therefore channel equalization can be implemented by a bank of one -tap complex frequency domain equalizers (FEQ) and signal detection is easily achieved.  The performance of the proposed algorithm is provided through computer simulations.
