Fast Kernels for Inexact String Matching
 Abstract.  We introduce several new families of string kernels designed in particular for use with support vector machines (SVMs) for classification of protein sequence data.  These kernels -- restricted gappy kernels, substitution kernels, and wildcard kernels -- are based on feature spaces indexed by k-length subsequences from the string alphabet # (or the alphabet augmented by a wildcard character), and hence they are related to the recently presented (k, m)-mismatch kernel and string kernels used in text classification.  However, for all kernels we define here, the kernel value K(x, y) can be computed in O(cK (
