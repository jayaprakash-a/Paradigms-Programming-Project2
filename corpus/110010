Probabilistic Space-Time Video Modeling via Piecewise GMM
 Abstract In this paper we describe a statistical video representation and modeling scheme.  Video representation schemes are needed to segment a video stream into meaningful video-objects, useful for later indexing and retrieval applications.  In the proposed methodology, unsupervised clustering via Gaussian mixture modeling extracts coherent space-time regions in feature space, and corresponding coherent segments (video-regions) in the video content.  A key feature of the system is the analysis of video input as a single entity as opposed to a sequence of separate frames.  Space and time are treated uniformly.  The probabilistic space-time video representation scheme is extended to a piecewise GMM framework in which a succession of GMMs are extracted for the video sequence, instead of a single global model for the entire sequence.  The piecewise GMM framework allows for the analysis of extended video sequences and the description of nonlinear, nonconvex motion patterns.  The extracted space-time regions allow for the detection and recognition of video events.  Results of segmenting video content into static vs.  dynamic video regions and video content editing are presented.
