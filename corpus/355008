Universalizing Speech: Notes from the USI Project
 Abstract This paper discusses progress in designing a standardized interface for speech interaction with simple machines -- the Universal Speech Interface (USI) project.  We discuss the motivation for such a design and issues that must be addressed by such an interface.  We present our current proposals for handling these issues, and comment on the usability of these approaches based on user interactions with the system.  Finally, we discuss future work and plans for the USI project.
