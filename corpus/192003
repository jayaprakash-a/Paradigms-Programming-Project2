A Vision Chip for Color Segmentation and Pattern Matching
 A 128(H) 64(V) RGB CMOS imager is integrated with region-of-interest selection, RGB-to-HSI transformation, HSI-based pixel segmentation, (36bins 12bits)-HSI histogramming, and sum-of-absolute-di#erence (SAD) template matching.  Thirty-two learned color templates are stored and compared to each image.  The chip captures the R, G, and B images using in-pixel storage before passing the pixel content to a multiplying digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for white balancing.  The DAC can also be used to pipe in images for a PC.  The color processing uses a biologically inspired color opponent representation and an analog lookup table to determine the Hue (H) of each pixel.  Saturation (S) is computed using a loser-take-all circuit.  Intensity (I) is given by the sum of the color components.  A histogram of the segments of the image, constructed by counting the number of pixels falling into 36 Hue intervals of 10 degrees, is stored on a chip and compared against the histograms of new segments using SAD comparisons.  We demonstrate color-based image segmentation and object recognition with this chip.  Running at 30 fps, it uses 1 mW.  To our knowledge, this is the first chip that integrates imaging, color segmentation, and color-based object recognition at the focal plane.
