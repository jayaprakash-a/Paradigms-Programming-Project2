Vector Regression: Theory and Algorithms
 Abstract We discuss the relation between #-Support Vector Regression (#-SVR) and #Support Vector Regression (#-SVR).  In particular we focus on properties which are different from those of C-Support Vector Classification (C-SVC) and #-Support Vector Classification (#-SVC).  We then discuss some issues which do not occur in the case of classification: the possible range of # and the scaling of target values.  A practical decomposition method for #-SVR is implemented and computational experiments are conducted.  We show some interesting numerical observations specific to regression.
