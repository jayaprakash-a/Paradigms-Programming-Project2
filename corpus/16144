HMM2- A NOVEL APPROACH TO HMM EMISSION PROBABILITY ESTIMATION HMM2- A NOVEL APPROACH TO HMM EMISSION PROBABILITY ESTIMATION
 Abstract: In this paper, we discuss and investigate a new method to estimate local emission probabilities in the framework of hidden Markov models (HMM).  Each feature vector is considered to be a sequence and is supposed to be modeled by yet another HMM.  Therefore, we call this approach `HMM2'.  There is a variety of possible topologies of such HMM2 systems, e. g.  incorporating trellis or ergodic HMM structures.  Preliminary HMM2 speech recognition experiments on cepstral and spectral features yielded worse results than state-of-the-art systems.  However, we believe that HMM2 systems have a lot of potential advantages and are therefore worth investigating further.
