Proposal for an Experiment Threshold
 Abstract We propose to investigate the threshold p(~e,e'p)0 reaction at q 2 =\Gamma 0:05 (GeV/c) 2 as a test of the predictions of chiral dynamics, a low energy approximation to QCD.  The structure functions oe L and oe T are determined by a Rosenbluth separation, oe TL and oe TT by the \Phi dependence of the cross section and oe TL' will be measured by an out of plane measurement with polarized electrons.  In addition we want to measure the q 2 dependence of the E 0+ and L 0+ multipole at\Gamma q 2 ! 0:1 (GeV/c) 2 .
