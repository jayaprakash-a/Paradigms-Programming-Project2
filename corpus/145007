FINDING CLUSTERS IN INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS
 ABSTRACT We present a class of algorithms that find clusters in independent component analysis: the data are linearly transformed so that the resulting components can be grouped into clusters, such that components are dependent within clusters and independent between clusters.  In order to find such clusters, we look for a transform that fits the estimated sources to a forest-structured graphical model.  In the nonGaussian, temporally independent case, the optimal transform is found by minimizing a contrast function based on mutual information that directly extends the contrast function used for classical ICA.  We also derive a contrast function in the Gaussian stationary case that is based on spectral densities and generalizes the contrast function of Pham [22] to richer classes of dependency.
