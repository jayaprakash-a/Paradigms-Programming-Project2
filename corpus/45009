To appear in Neural Computation Minimizing Binding Errors Using Learned Conjunctive Features
 Abstract We have studied some of the design tradeoffs governing visual representations based on spatially-invariant conjunctive feature detectors, with an emphasis on the susceptibility of such systems to false-positive recognition errors
