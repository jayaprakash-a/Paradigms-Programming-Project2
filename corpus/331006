How to Estimate the Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension of Support Vector Machines Through Simulations ?
 Abstract Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension appears as one of the central concepts in Statistical Learning Theory (Vapnik 1995, 1998).  Though it led to some important mathematical results and contributed to the development of a new class of very efficient algorithms, the Support Vector Machines, there are few attempts (Vapnik et al. , 1994, Vapnik 1995) to turn VC dimension into a practical notion that could be measured or observed in particular learning problems.  In the presentpaper,we review some techniques for computing VC dimension through simulations and, after pointing out some theoretical observations, we propose a new set-up for numerical experiments.
