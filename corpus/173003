A Blind Fractionally Spaced Equalizer Using Higher Order Statistics
 Abstract---In this paper, we introduce a new blind fractionally spaced equalizer based on the fourth-order statistics of the input symbol sequence.  The input symbol sequence is assumed to come from an independent identically distributed finite alphabet with nonzero fourth-order cumulants.  We formulate the equalizer as a column vector and compute it by simultaneously diagonalizing a set of matrices obtained from the fourth-order cross-cumulants of the input and output of the equalizer.  Simulation results show that this equalizer works well with a short symbol sequence, even if the channel time span is not accurately estimated.
