Shape-Based Image Indexing and Retrieval for Diagnostic Pathology
 Abstract A prototype system performing analysis, indexing and retrieval of pathology images to assist physicians in differential diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders is presented.  Robust color segmentation is used to automatically analyse regions of interest in images of leukocytes.  The shape of leukocyte nuclei, described through similarity invariant shape descriptors, represents the main attribute in the search query.  Monte Carlo tests for stability and goaldirected evaluations of the system performance are also shown.
