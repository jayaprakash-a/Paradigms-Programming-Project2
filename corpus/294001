RHEOLOGY AND GLASSY DYNAMICS OF FOAMS
 Abstract.  After a brief `warm-up' discussion of osmotic pressure of foams, the basic phenomena of foam rheology are reviewed, focusing on linear viscoelastic spectra (elastic and loss moduli) with brief mention of nonlinear effects.  Theoretical models for some of these properties are then described, starting with Princen's model for the elastic modulus G 0 of an ordered foam in two dimensions.  There is a basic conflict between this model, which predicts a step-function onset of the modulus when droplets first contact at volume fraction OE = OE 0 , and the experimental data (which show G 0 OE \Gamma OE 0 ).  The three dimensional ordered case is reviewed next, focusing on anharmonic deformation theory which predicts a logarithmic softening of the modulus near OE 0 ; this is still not soft enough to explain the observations.  The 3D disordered case is then addressed; a combination of disorder and the anharmonic effect finally seems able to explain the data.  We then consider the problem of the frequency-dependent loss modulus G 00 (!) which describes dissipation in a foam.  Somewhat alarmingly, the data suggest behaviour incompatible with linear response theory; reconciliation is possible if one invokes some very slow relaxation processes at timescales longer than experiment.  We briefly describe the search for foam-specific slow relaxation mechanisms of surfactant and water transport, which so far has yielded no viable candidates.  Since similar anomalies in G 00 (!) are observed in several other systems, they are instead tentatively ascribed to a generic phenomenon: glassy dynamics.  A recent model for the rheology of "soft glassy matter" is then reviewed; though phenomenological, this suggests that glassy dynamics may be a useful concept in foam rheology.
