KCCA for fMRI Analysis
 Abstract.  We use Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) to infer brain activity in functional MRI by learning a semantic representation of fMRI brain scans and their associated activity signal.  The semantic space provides a common representation and enables a comparison between the fMRI and the activity signal.  We compare the approach against Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) by localising "activity" on a simulated null data set.  Finally we present an approach to reconstruct an activity signal from a testing-set fMRI scans (both simulated and real), a method which allows us to validate our initial analysis.
