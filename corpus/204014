A social reinforcement learning agent
 ABSTRACT We report on our reinforcement learning work on Cobot, a software agent that resides in the well-known online chat community LambdaMOO.  Our initial work on Cobot [Isbell et al. 2000] provided him with the ability to collect social statistics and report them to users in a reactive manner.  Here we describe our application of reinforcement learning to allow Cobot to proactively take actions in this complex social environment, and adapt his behavior from multiple sources of human reward.  After 5 months of training, Cobot received 3171 reward and punishmentevents from 254 different LambdaMOO users, and learned nontrivial preferences for a number of users.  Cobot modifies his behavior based on his current state in an attempt to maximize reward.  Here we describe LambdaMOO and the state and action spaces of Cobot, and report the statistical results of the learning experiment.
