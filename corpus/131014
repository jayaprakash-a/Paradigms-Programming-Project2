ELECTRON CLOUD POTENTIAL REMEDIES FOR THE VACUUM SYSTEM OF THE SPS
 Abstract The SPS has recently exhibited strong pressure rises, up to 10 --7 Torr with 610 12 circulating protons, caused by intense electron bombardment as a result of electron multipacting, in the presence of LHC type beams.  A number of potential remedies to combat the build-up of an electron cloud have been discussed in the context of the LHC.  These proposals have ranged from using well--defined surfaces, provided by special coatings, preparations or treatments and/or in-situ cleaning, such as bake-out or beam scrubbing, to the integration of longitudinal clearing electrodes or solenoid fields.  For completeness, machine parameters, such as the bunch separation, have also been reconsidered.  These potential cures to limit the pressure rises in the SPS in the presence of LHC type beams are addressed in this paper.
