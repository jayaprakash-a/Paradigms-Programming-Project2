An Economic Approach to Cultural Capital
 Abstract This paper introduces a sociological notion of cultural capital into economics.  This is modeled as an infinitely repeated game in which the likelihood of future play (i. e.  discount factor) is a function of group specific human capital investments made by the agents before the interactions begin.  It is shown that: (1) some individuals expected to make group-specific human capital investments are worse o2 because their observed investment behavior is used as a "cultural identifier" vis--vis the endogenous probability of continuation play; (2) equilibria exhibit bipolar human capital investment behavior by individuals of similar innate ability; (3) as social mobility increases, this bi-polarization increases; and (4) popular policy prescriptions such as educational and job interventions designed to encourage human capital acquisition can have adverse results in the cultural capital model.
