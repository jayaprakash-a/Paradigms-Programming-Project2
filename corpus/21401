Deriving Intrinsic Images from Image Sequences
 Abstract Intrinsic images are a useful midlevel description of scenes proposed by Barrow and Tenenbaum [1].  An image is decomposed into two images: a reflectance image and an illumination image.  Finding such a decomposition remains a difficult problem in computer vision.  Here we focus on a slightly easier problem: given a sequence of T images where the reflectance is constant and the illumination changes, can we recover T illumination images and a single reflectance image? We show that this problem is still illposed and suggest approaching it as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem.  Following recent work on the statistics of natural images, we use a prior that assumes that illumination images will give rise to sparse filter outputs.  We show that this leads to a simple, novel algorithm for recovering reflectance images.  We illustrate the algorithm's performance on real and synthetic image sequences.
