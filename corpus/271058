Building Domain-Specific Search Engines with Machine Learning Techniques
 Abstract Domain-specific search engines are growing in popularity because they offer increased accuracy and extra functionality not possible with the general, Web-wide search engines.  For example, www. campsearch. com allows complex queries by age-group, size, location and cost over summer camps.  Unfortunately these domain-specific search engines are difficult and timeconsuming to maintain.  This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific search engines.  We describe new research in reinforcement learning, information extraction and text classification that enables efficient spidering, identifying informative text segments, and populating topic hierarchies.  Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a search engine for computer science research papers.  It already contains over 50,000 papers and is publicly available at www. cora. justresearch. com.
