An Efficient Boosting Algorithm for Combining Preferences
 Abstract.  The problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as combining the results of different search engines.  This work describes an efficient algorithm for combining multiple preferences.  We first give a formal framework for the problem.  We then describe and analyze a new boosting algorithm for combining preferences called RankBoost.  We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a restricted case.  We discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost.  In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different WWW search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain.  For this task, we compare the performance of RankBoost to the individual search strategies.  The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations.  Here, we present results comparing RankBoost to nearest-neighbor and regression algorithms.
