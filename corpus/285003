Time-varying Shape Tensors for Scenes with Multiply Moving Points
 Abstract We derive single view indexing functions for dynamic scenes where dynamic is defined as a scene consisting of multiply moving points each moving independently with constant velocity.  The indexing functions we derive are view independent and form a generalization of the ^shape tensors~ associated with rigid scenes by introducing a time-varying parameter.  We derive those indexing functions under full 3D projective, 3D af#ne, and various reduced configurations.  The indexing functions were implemented and tested for matching against objects for which their non-rigid motion is an intrinsic part of their character human gait recognition and hand gesture identification are the two chosen application examples.
