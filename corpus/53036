Unsupervised Texture Segmentation on the Basis of Scale Space Features
 Abstract A novel approach to unsupervised texture segmentation is presented, which is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem known as sparse pairwise data clustering.  Pairwise dissimilarities between texture blocks are measured by scale space features, i. e. , multi-resolution edges.  These scale space features are computed by a Gabor filter bank tuned to spatial frequencies.  To solve the data clustering problem a deterministic annealing technique is applied.  This approach is examined from the viewpoint of scale space theory.  Based on a meanfield approximation an efficient algorithm is derived.  We present an application of the proposed algorithm to Brodatz-like microtexture collages.
