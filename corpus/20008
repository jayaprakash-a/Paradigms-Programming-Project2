On the Theory of Average Case Complexity
 Abstract This paper takes the next step in developing the theory of average case complexity initiated by Leonid A Levin.  Previous works [Levin 84, Gurevich 87, Venkatesan and Levin 88] have focused on the existence of complete problems.  We widen the scope to other basic questions in computational complexity.  Our results include: ffl the equivalence of search and decision problems in the context of average case complexity; ffl an initial analysis of the structure of distributional-NP (i. e.  NP problems coupled with ``simple distributions") under reductions which preserve average polynomial-time; ffl a proof that if all of distributional-NP is in average polynomial-time then non-deterministic exponential-time equals deterministic exponential time (i. e. , a collapse in the worst case hierarchy)
