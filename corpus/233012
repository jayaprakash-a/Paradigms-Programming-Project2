A Note on Ideal Tripartite Access Structures
 Abstract Padro and Saez [PS] introduced the concept of a k-partite access structure for secret sharing and gave a complete characterization of ideal bipartite structures.  We derive a necessary condition for ideal tripartite structures, which we conjecture is necessary for all k.
