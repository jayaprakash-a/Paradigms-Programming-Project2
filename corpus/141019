Valid Generalisation from Approximate Interpolation
 Abstract Let H and C be sets of functions from domain X to !.  We say that H validly generalises C from approximate interpolation if and only if for each j ? 0 and ffl; ffi 2 (0; 1) there is m 0 (j; ffl; ffi ) such that for any function t 2 C and any probability distribution P on X, if m m 0 then with P m probability at least 1 \Gamma ffi , a sample x = (x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; xm ) 2 X m satisfies 8h 2 H; jh(x i )\Gamma t(x i )j ! j; (1 i m) =) P(fx : jh(x)\Gamma t(x)j jg) ! ffl: We find conditions that are necessary and sufficient for H to validly generalise C from approximate interpolation, and we obtain bounds on the sample length m 0 (j; ffl; ffi ) in terms of various parameters describing the expressive power of H.
