Analysis of Switching Dynamics with Competing Support Vector Machines
 Abstract We present a framework for the unsupervised segmentation of switching dynamics using support vector machines.  Following the architecture by Pawelzik et al.  [21] where annealed competing neural networks were used to segment a non-stationary time series, in this article we exploit the use of support vector machines, a well-known learning technique.  First, a new formulation of support vector regression is proposed.  Second, an expectation-maximization (EM) step is suggested to adaptively adjust the annealing parameter.  Results indicate that the proposed approach is promising.
