Model selection for automated reconstruction from multiple views
 Abstract We describe progress in automatically fitting a plane plus modelled perturbation surface model to represent architectural scenes.  There are two areas of novelty.  The first is a method of fitting parametrized models in which the cost function is based on a combination of disparity and gradient extrema, both computed over multiple views.  The second is the use of an evaluation criteria for model selection, learnt from training examples.  We demonstrate the method on reconstructions of several college scenes from multiple images.
