 Abstract We investigate the construction of more precise estimates of a collection of population means using information about a related variable in the context of repeated sample surveys.  The method is illustrated using poll results concerning presidential approval rating (our related variable is political party identification).  We use post-stratification to construct these improved estimates, but since we don't have population level information on the post-stratifying variable, we construct a model for the manner in which the post-stratifier develops over time.  In this manner, we obtain more precise estimates without making possibly untenable assumptions about the dynamics of our variable of interest, the presidential approval rating.
