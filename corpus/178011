VLSI POTENTIOSTAT ARRAY FOR DISTRIBUTED ELECTROCHEMICAL NEURAL RECORDING
 ABSTRACT A neurochemical sensor system is being developed to spatially sense and process neurotransmitters.  This paper reports the design and VLSI implementation of a multichannel potentiostat that interfaces to a nitric-oxide (NO) sensor array.  Picoampere to microampere input currents are range-normalized with programmable gain, and digitized by a bank of current-mode delta-sigma analog-to-digital (A/D) converters.  First-order noise shaping and 4,096-fold oversampling provide high signal-to-noise ratio for the lowfrequency NO transients.  A shift register scans the buffered decimated delta-sigma outputs in bit-serial format providing asynchronous sequential readout.  An 8-channel potentiostat in 0. 5 mCMOS measures 1. 5mm \Theta 1. 5mm, and consumes 0. 5 mW power.  The device is expected to serve as a valuable tool for neurophysiological research and implantable neural prostheses.
