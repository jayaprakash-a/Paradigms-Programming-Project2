Probabilistic Models for Generating, Modelling and Matching Image Categories
 Abstract In this paper we present a probabilistic and continuous framework for supervised image category modelling and matching as well as unsupervised clustering of image space into image categories.  A generalized GMM-KL framework is described in which each image or image-set (category) is represented as a Gaussian mixture distribution and images (categories) are compared and matched via a probabilistic measure of similarity between distributions.  Image-tocategory matching is investigated and unsupervised clustering of a random image set into visually coherent image categories is demonstrated.
