Efficient Parametric Projection Pursuit Density Estimation
 Abstract Product models of low dimensional experts are a powerful way to avoid the curse of dimensionality.  We present the \undercomplete product of experts" (UPoE), where each expert models a one dimensional projection of the data.  The UPoE may be interpreted as a parametric probabilistic model for projection pursuit.  Its ML learning rules are identical to the approximate learning rules proposed before for under-complete ICA.  We also derive an ecient sequential learning algorithm and discuss its relationship to projection pursuit density estimation and feature induction algorithms for additive random field models.
