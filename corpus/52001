Automatic volumetric segmentation of human visual retinotopic cortex
 Abstract Previous identification of early visual cortical areas in humans with phase-encoded retinotopic mapping techniques have relied on an accurate cortical surface reconstruction.  Here a 3D phase-encoded retinotopic mapping technique that does not require a reconstruction of the cortical surface is demonstrated.  The visual field sign identification is completely automatic and the method directly supplies volumes for a region-of-interest analysis, facilitating the application of cortical mapping to a wider population.  A validation of the method is provided by simulations and comparison to cortical surface-based methodology.  2003 Elsevier Science (USA).  All rights reserved.
