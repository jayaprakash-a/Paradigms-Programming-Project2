Automatic line matching across views
 Abstract This paper presents a new method for matching individual line segments between images.  The method uses both greylevel information and the multiple view geometric relations between the images.  For image pairs epipolar geometry facilitates the computation of a cross-correlation based matching score for putative line correspondences.  For image triplets cross-correlation matching scores are used in conjunction with line transfer based on the trifocal geometry.  Algorithms are developed for both short and long range motion.  In the case of long range motion the algorithm involves evaluating a one parameter family of plane induced homographies.  The algorithms are robust to deficiencies in the line segment extraction and partial occlusion.  Experimental results are given for image pairs and triplets, for varying motions between views, and for different scene types.  The three view algorithm eliminates all mismatches.
