Response Functions Improving Performance in Analogue Attractor Neural Networks
 Abstract In the context of attractor neural networks, we study how the equilibrium analogue neural activities, reached by the network dynamics during memory retrieval, may improve storage performance by reducing the interferences between the recalled pattern and the other stored ones.  We determine a simple dynamics that stabilizes network states which are highly correlated with the retrieved pattern, for a number of stored memories that does not exceed ff ? N , where ff ? 2 [0; 0:41] depends on the global activity level in the network and N is the number of neurons.  87.
