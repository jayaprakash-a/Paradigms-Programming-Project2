On Applying Molecular Computation to the Data Encryption Standard
 and Lipton described thepotential use of molecular computation in attacking the United States Data Encryption Standard (DES).  Here, we provideadescription of suchan attackusingthesticker model of molecular computation.  Our analysis suggests that such an attack might be mounted on a table-top machine, using approximately a gram of DNA and might succeed even in the presence of a large number of errors.
