Alternating Projection for Independent Component Analysis
 Abstract We describe a non-parametric method for performing independent component analysis via alternating minimization or alternating information projections.  The method iteratively minimizes the KLdivergence between two manifolds in probability space.  The first is the manifold of all factorized or independent distributions.  The other is a manifold of all rotated versions of the data's empirical distribution.  Projections from each manifold to the closest point in the other involve minimizing KL divergences or information projections in probability space.  The projection onto the manifold of factorized distributions from a given empirical one is trivial.  The projection from a factorized distribution to the manifold of rotated data distributions involves computing the cumulative density function in each dimension to equalize each distribution and iteratated variational singular value decompositions.  This leads to an ecient algorithm that monotonically decreases the KL-divergence from a distribution and its factorized approximation.  The final converged rotations recover the independent components in the data.
