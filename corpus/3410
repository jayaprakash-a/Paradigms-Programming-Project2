An Optimized Interaction Strategy for Bayesian Relevance Feedback
 Abstract A new algorithm and systematic evaluation is presented for searching a database via relevance feedback.  It represents a new image display strategy for the PicHunter system [2, 1].  The algorithm takes feedback in the form of relative judgments ("item A is more relevant than item B") as opposed to the stronger assumption of categorical relevance judgments ("item A is relevant but item B is not").  It also exploits a learned probabilistic model of human behavior to make better use of the feedback it obtains.  The algorithm can be viewed as an extension of indexing schemes like the k-d tree to a stochastic setting, hence the name "stochastic-comparison search. " In simulations, the amount of feedback required for the new algorithm scales like log 2 jDj, where jDj is the size of the database, while a simple query-by-exampleapproach scales like jDj a , where a ! 1 depends on the structure of the database.  This theoretical advantage is reflected by experiments with real users on a database of 1500 stock photographs.
