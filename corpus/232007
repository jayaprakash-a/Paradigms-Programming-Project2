A Multi-agent Architecture Integrating Learning and Fuzzy Techniques for Landmark-Based Robot Navigation
 Abstract This paper extends a navigation system implemented as a multi-agent system (MAS).  The arbitration mechanism controlling the interactions between the agents was based on manually-tuned bidding functions.  A diculty with hand-tuning is that it is hard to handle situations involving complex tradeoffs.  In this paper we explore the suitability of reinforcement learning for automatically tuning agents within a MAS to optimize a complex tradeoff, namely the camera use.
