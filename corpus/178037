16-CHANNEL WIDE-RANGE VLSI POTENTIOSTAT ARRAY
 ABSTRACT A 16-Channel current-measuring VLSI sensor array system for electrochemical detection of electroactive neurotransmiters like dopamine and nitric-oxide is presented.  The designed ADC architecture is first-order single bit delta-sigma modulator with programmable oversampling ratio.  The modulation of feedback duty-cycle in modulator design enables choice of current range in accordance to magnitude and time constant of signal leading to current range that spans over six orders of magnitude and sensitivity up to picoamperes at hundred millisecond conversion time with power consumption of 300 W.  A 3mm x 3mm chip in 0. 5 m CMOS technology is used for real-time multi-channel acquisition of neurotransmitter concentration.
