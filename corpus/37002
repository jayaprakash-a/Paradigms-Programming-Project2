A Framework for Plan Execution in Behaviour-Based Robots
 This paper presents a conceptual architecture for autonomous robots that integrates behaviour-based and goal-directed action as by following a traditional action plan.  Dual Dynamics is the formalism for describing behaviourbased action.  Partial-order propositional plans, which get generated by GRAPHPLAN, are used as a basis for acting goal-directedly; the concept is suitable for using other planning methods and plan representations, though.  The paper presents the corresponding action and plan representations at the plan side and at the behaviour side.  Moreover, it describes how behaviour-based action is biased towards executing a plan and how information from the behaviour side is fed back to the plan side to determine progress in the plan execution.
