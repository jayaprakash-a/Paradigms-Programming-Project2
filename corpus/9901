Using Expectation-Maximisation to Learn Dynamical Models from Visual Data
 Abstract Tracking with deformable contours in a filtering framework requires a dynamical model for prediction.  For any given application, tracking is improved by having an accurate model, learnt from training data.  We develop a method for learning dynamical models from training sequences, explicitly taking account of the fact that our data are measurements and not true states.  By introducing an `augmentedstate smoothing filter', we show how the technique of ExpectationMaximisation can be applied to this problem, and show that the resulting algorithm produces more robust and accurate tracking.
