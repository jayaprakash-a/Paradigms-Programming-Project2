Permutation Tests for Classification
 Abstract.  We describe a permutation procedure used extensively in classification problems in computational biology and medical imaging.  We empirically study the procedure on simulated data and real examples from neuroimaging studies and DNA microarray analysis.  A theoretical analysis is also suggested to assess the asymptotic behavior of the test.  An interesting observation is that concentration of the permutation procedure is controlled by a Rademacher average which also controls the concentration of empirical errors to expected errors.
