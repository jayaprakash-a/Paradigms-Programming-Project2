Communicating Ada Tasks
 Abstract.  Ada has proven successful in the area of high integrity systems development, but its tasking model is hard to reason about.  Thus, Ravenscar has been defined as a restricted subset of the Ada tasking model, which meets the requirements of producing analysable and deterministic code.  A central feature of Ravenscar is the use of protected objects to ensure mutually exclusive access to shared data.  In this paper, we use Ravenscar protected objects to implement CSP channels in Ada.  This allows us to transform the data-oriented asynchronous tasking model of Ravenscar into the cleaner, and better understood, messagepassing synchronous model of CSP. Thus, formal proofs and techniques for model-checking CSP specifications can be applied to Ravenscar programs.  In turn, this raises our confidence in these programs and their reliability. We will formally verify our implementation of the CSP channel using the Circus model of Ravenscar protected objects providedin[3].
