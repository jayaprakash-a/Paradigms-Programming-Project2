 Abstract.  Mean field methods provide computationally efficient approximations to posterior probability distributions for graphical models.  Simple mean field methods make a completely factorized approximation to the posterior, which is unlikely to be accurate when the posterior is multimodal.  Indeed, if the posterior is multi-modal, only one of the modes can be captured.  To improve the mean field approximation in such cases, we employ mixture models as posterior approximations, where each mixture component is a factorized distribution.  We describe efficient methods for optimizing the parameters in these models.
