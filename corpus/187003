Semantic Organization of Scenes using Discriminant Structural Templates
 Abstract In this paper, we present a procedure for organizing real world scenes along semantic axes.  The approach is based on the output energies of linear discriminant filters that take into account, or not, spatial information.  We introduce three semantic axes along which pictures are ordered.  The main semantic axis computes the degree of naturalness of a scene.  Then, urban pictures are evaluated according to their degree of verticalness and natural scenes, according to their degree of openness.  We observe the emergence of typical scene categories such as beach, mountain, skyscrapers, city center, etc. , along the axes.
