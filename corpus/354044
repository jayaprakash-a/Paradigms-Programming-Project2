Building Steiner Trees with Incomplete Global Knowledge
 Abstract A networking problem of present day interest is that of distributing a single data item to multiple clients while minimizing network usage.  Steiner tree algorithms are a natural solution method, but only when the set of clients requesting the data is known.  We study what can be done without this global knowledge, when a given vertex knows only the probability that any other client will wish to be connected, and must simply specify a fixed path to the data to be used in case it is requested.  Our problem is an example of a class of network design problems with concave cost functions (which arise when the design problem exhibits economies of scale).  In order to solve our problem, we introduce a new version of the facility location problem: one in which every open facility is required to have some minimum amount of demand assigned to it.  We present a simple bicriterion approximation for this problem, one which is loose in both assignment cost and minimum demand, but within a constant factor of the optimum for both.  This suffices for our application.  We leave open the question of finding an algorithm that produces a truly feasible approximate solution.
