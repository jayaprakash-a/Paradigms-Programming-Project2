An Ecient Exact Algorithm for Singly Connected Graphical Games
 Abstract We describe a new algorithm for computing a Nash equilibrium in graphical games , a compact representation for multi-agent systems that we introduced in previous work.  The algorithm is the first to compute equilibria both eciently and exactly for a non-trivial class of graphical games.
