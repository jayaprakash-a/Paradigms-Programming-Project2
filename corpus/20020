Learning Distributions by Their Density Levels: A Paradigm for Learning without a Teacher
 Abstract We propose a mathematical model for learning the high-density areas of an unknown distribution from (unlabeled) random points drawn according to this distribution.  While this type of a learning task has not been previously addressed in the Computational Learnability literature, we believe that this it a rather basic problem that appears in many practical learning scenarios.  From a statistical theory standpoint, our model may be viewed as a restricted instance of the fundamental issue of inferring information about a probability distribution from the random samples it generates.  From a computational learning angle, what we propose is a new framework of un-supervised concept learning.  The examples provided to the learner in our model are not labeled (and are not necessarily all positive or all negative).  The only information about their membership is indirectly disclosed to the student through the sampling distribution.  We investigate the basic features of the proposed model and provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of such learning tasks.  Our main result is that the learnability of a class of distributions in this setting is equivalent to the finiteness of the VC-dimension of the class of the high-density areas of these distributions.  One direction of the proof involves a reduction of the density-level-learnability to p-concepts learnability, while the sufficiency condition is proved through the introduction of a generic learning algorithm.
