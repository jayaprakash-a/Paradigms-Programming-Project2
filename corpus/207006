Static Ranking of Web Pages, and Related Ideas
 Abstract This working paper reviews some dierent ideas in link-based analysis for search.  First, results about static ranking of web pages based on the so called randomsurfer model are reviewed and presented in a unified framework.  Second, a topic-based hubs and authorities model using a discrete component method (a variant of ICA and PCA) is developed, and illustrated on the 500,000 page English language Wikipedia collection.  Third, a proposal is presented to the community for a Links/Ranking consortium extracted from the Web Intelligence paper Opportunities from Open Source Search.
