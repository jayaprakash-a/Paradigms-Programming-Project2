High level vision with a single feed-forward pass?
 Abstract Vision certainly in volves both feed-forward and feed-back based mechanisms.  But are there visual tasks that can be performed using just a single feed-forward pass? Behavioural and electrophysiological data suggest that some high level tasks that include detecting the presence of an animalin a natural scene can be performed so quickly that there seems to be little if any opportunity to make use of iterative mechanisms.  Other evidence comes from simulation studies with SpikeNet, an image processing system that uses very large scale networks of asynchronously firing neurons.  The latest version allows very efficient object identification in real-time using a video input, and although this specific implementation is designed to run on standard computer hardware, there are a number of clear implications for computational neuroscience.  Specifically, SpikeNet demonstrates the plausibility of visual processing based on a single feed-forward pass and very sparse levels of firing.  Above all, it is one of the very few models compatible with the severe temporal constraints imposed by experimental data on processing speed in the visual system.
