Optimisation of on--line principal component analysis
 Abstract Various techniques, used to optimise on-line principal component analysis, are investigated by methods of statistical mechanics.  These include local and global optimisation of node-dependent learning-rates which are shown to be very efficient in speeding up the learning process.  They are investigated further for gaining insight into the learning rates' timedependence, which is then employed for devising simple practical methods to improve training performance.  Simulations demonstrate the benefit gained from using the new methods.
