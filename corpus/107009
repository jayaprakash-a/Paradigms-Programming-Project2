Provably Fast Algorithms for Anomaly Detection Los Alamos National Laboratory
 Abstract We describe a solution method for one of the most common anomaly detection formulations [23] that is proven to be computationally ecient, universally consistent, and to guarantee near optimal finite sample performance for a large class of (practical) distributions [23, 21].  We also describe an algorithm for this method that accepts the desired accuracy # as an input and produces an approximate solution that is guaranteed to satisfy this accuracy in low order polynomial time.  Experimental results are used to demonstrate the actual run times for a typical problem.
