Linear Dependency between epsilon and the Input Noise in epsilon-Support Vector Regression
 Abstract.  In using the ffl-support vector regression (ffl-SVR) algorithm, one has to decide on a suitable value of the insensitivity parameter ffl.  Smola et al.  [6] determined its "optimal" choice based on maximizing the statistical efficiency of a location parameter estimator.  While they successfully predicted a linear scaling between the optimal ffl and the noise in the data, the value of the theoretically optimal ffl does not have a close match with its experimentally observed counterpart.  In this paper, we attempt to better explain the experimental results there, by analyzing a toy problem with a closer setting to the ffl-SVR.  Our resultant predicted choice of ffl is much closer to the experimentally observed value, while still demonstrating a linear trend with the data noise.
