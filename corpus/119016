Robust Multimodality Registration for Brain Mapping
 Abstract: We present a robust intrasubject registration method for the synergistic use of multiple neuroimaging modalities, with applications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, perfusion MRI, MR spectroscopy, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).  This method allows user-friendly processing of difficult examinations (low spatial resolution, advanced pathology, motion during acquisition, and large areas of focal activation).  Registration of three-dimensional (3D) brain scans is initially estimated by first-order moment matching, followed by iterative anisotrophic chamfer matching of brain surfaces.  Automatic brain surface extraction is performed in all imaging modalities.  A new generalized distance definition and new specific methodologies allow registration of scans that cover only a limited range of brain surface.  A new semiautomated supervision scheme allows fast and intuitive corrections of possible false automatic registration results.  The accuracy of the MRI/SPECT anatomical-functional correspondence obtained was evaluated using simulations and two difficult clinical populations (tumors and degenerative brain disorders).  The average discrimination capability of SPECT (12. 4 mm in-plane resolution, 20 mm slice thickness) was found to be better than 5 mm after registration with MRI (5 mm slice thickness).  Registration accuracy was always better than imaging resolution.  Complete 3D MRI and SPECT registration time ranged between 6--11 min, in which surface matching represented 2--3 min.  No registration failure occurred.  In conclusion, the application of several new image processing techniques allowed efficient and robust registration.  Hum.
