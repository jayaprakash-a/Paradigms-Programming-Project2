An Application of Linear Response Learning
 Abstract Linear response is an approximation method for Boltzmann machines based on mean field theory.  It is known that in the absence of hidden units this method can learn the network quite accurately with the costs of only one matrix inversion.  We show that adding a flat distribution to the target can decrease the classification error.  We apply linear response learning to a real world data set of digit recognition.  We show that the this method can compete with other known methods.  An advantage of linear response is the fast learning.
