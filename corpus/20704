A Scalable Topic-Based Open Source Search Engine
 Abstract Site-based or topic-specific search engines work with mixed success because of the general difficulty of the information retrieval task, and the lack of good link information to allow authorities to be identified.  We are advocating an open source approach to the problem due to its scope and need for software components.  We have adopted a topicbased search engine because it represents the next generation of capability.  This paper outlines our scalable system for site-based or topic-specific search, and demonstrates the developing system on a small 250,000 document collection of EU and UN web pages.
