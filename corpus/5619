Ada: a playful interactive space
 Abstract: This paper and the accompanying video describe Ada, an immersive 160m 2 space for human-machine interaction.  Ada is conceived as an artificial organism that plays with its visitors, with multi-modal sensors consisting of pressure-sensitive floor tiles, microphones for localising and recognising sounds, and pan-tilt video cameras called gazers.  Her output modalities include a 360video projection screen capable of showing realtime computer graphics combined with multiple live video streams, RGB neon lights in the floor tiles, pan-tilt lights and an automatic neural music composition system.  Visitors provided input to the space primarily by moving around, clapping their hands and speaking.  Ada was presented at the Swiss national exhibition Expo. 02 in Neuchtel from May 15 to October 20, 2002, and attracted 553,700 visitors.  In this paper we give a brief overview of the Ada exhibit, and describe the accompanying video.
