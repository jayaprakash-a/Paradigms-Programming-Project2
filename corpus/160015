2003 Special issue Modeling goal-directed spatial navigation in the rat based on physiological data from the hippocampal formation
 Abstract We investigated the importance of hippocampal theta oscillations and the significance of phase differences of theta modulation in the cortical regions that are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation.  Our models used representations of entorhinal cortex layer III (ECIII), hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) to guide movements of a virtual rat in a virtual environment.  The model encoded representations of the environment through long-term potentiation of excitatory recurrent connections between sequentially spiking place cells in ECIII and CA3.  This encoding required buffering of place cell activity, which was achieved by a short-term memory (STM) in EC that was regulated by theta modulation and allowed synchronized reactivation with encoding phases in ECIII and CA3.  Inhibition at a specific theta phase deactivated the oldest item in the buffer when new input was presented to a full STM buffer.  A 1808 phase difference separated retrieval and encoding in ECIII and CA3, which enabled us to simulate data on theta phase precession of place cells.  Retrieval of known paths was elicited in ECIII by input at the retrieval phase from PFC working memory for goal location, requiring strict theta phase relationships with PFC.  Known locations adjacent to the virtual rat were retrieved in CA3.  Together, input from ECIII and CA3 activated predictive spiking in cells in CA1 for the next desired place on a shortest path to a goal.  Consistent with data, place cell activity in CA1 and CA3 showed smaller place fields than in ECIII.
