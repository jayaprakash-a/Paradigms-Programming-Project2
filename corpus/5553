First-Order Conditional Logic Revisited
 Abstract Conditional logics play an important role in recent attempts to investigate default reasoning.  This paper investigates firstorder conditional logic.  We show that, as for first-order probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as "most birds fly"), and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as "I believe that Tweety is unlikely to fly").  We then address the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional logic.  As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics.  To study the problem in a coherent way, we use plausibility structures.
