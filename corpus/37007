The Dual Dynamics Design Scheme for Behavior-based Robots: A Tutorial
 Abstract: This paper is a tutorial on a particular method for designing behavior-based robots, the dual dynamics (DD) scheme.  The DD scheme guides the specification of multilevel control architectures in a format of differential equations.  DD design is characterized by two principal properties.  First, behaviors are construed as dynamical systems, which consist of two subsystems (hence the name, "dual dynamics").  One subsystem generates the behavior's dynamics proper, the other is responsible for activating and de-activating the behavior.  The second principal property is that higher levels in the control architecture do not directly "call" lower-level behaviors to execute.  Rather, a higher-level behavior can ``configure" the entire lower level, which thereafter can operate fully on its own, without ongoing supervision by the higher level.
