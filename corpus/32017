LANGUAGE MODELING USING EFFICIENT BEST-FIRST BOTTOM-UP PARSING
 ABSTRACT In this paper we present a two-stage best-first bottom-up word-lattice parser which we use as a language model for speech recognition.  The parser works by using a "Figure of Merit" that selects lattice paths while simultaneously selecting syntactic category edges for parsing.  Additionally, we introduce a modified version of the Inside-Outside algorithm used as a pruning stage between syntactic context-free parsing and lexicalized context-dependent parsing.  We report our results in terms of Word Error Rate on the HUB--1 word-lattices and compare these results to other syntactic language modeling techniques.
