Nonlinear analysis of orientation tuning: Stationary properties of simple cells in V1
 Abstract This paper presents a new approximation method for localized ("bumpy") steady state activation patterns in truly nonlinear neural field equations.  The method is applied to models for orientation tuning in V1 simple cells where it allows to study the impact of nonlinear rate-functions on tuning properties and a derivation of explicit formulas for response amplitudes and tuning widths in dependence of network parameters and stimulus properties.
