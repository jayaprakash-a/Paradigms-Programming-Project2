LIBSVM: Introduction and Benchmarks
 Abstract Most available support vector machines (SVM) software are either quite complicated or are not suitable for large problems.  Instead of seeking a very fast software for dicult problems, we provide a simple, easy-to-use, and moderately ecient package for SVM classification: LIBSVM.  It is a simplification of both SMO by Platt and SV M light by Joachims.  LIBSVM is also a simplification of the modification 2 of SMO by Keerthi et al.  We hope it helps users from other fields to easily use SVM as a tool.  This document includes the introduction of the software and benchmarks.
