Minimum cuts in near-linear time
 Abstract We significantly improve known time bounds for solving the minimum cut problem on undirected graphs.  We use a "semi-duality" between minimum cuts and maximum spanning tree packings combined with our previously developed random sampling techniques.  We give a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm that finds a minimum cut in an m-edge, n-vertex graph with high probability in O(m log 3 n) time.  We also give a simpler randomized algorithm that finds all minimum cuts with high probability in O(n 2 log n) time.  This variant has an optimal RNC parallelization.  Both variants improve on the previous best time bound of O(n 2 log 3 n).  Other applications of the tree-packing approach are new, nearly tight bounds on the number of near-minimum cuts a graph may have and a new data structure for representing them in a space-efficient manner.
