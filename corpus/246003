Scale Selection for Anisotropic Scale-Space: Application to Volumetric Tumor Characterization
 Abstract A unified approach for treating the scale selection problem in the anisotropic scale-space is proposed.  The anisotropic scale-space is a generalization of the classical isotropic Gaussian scale-space by considering the Gaussian kernel with a fully parameterized analysis scale (bandwidth) matrix.  The "maximum-over-scales" and the "moststable-over-scales" criteria are constructed by employing the "0 -normalized scale-space derivatives", i. e. , responsenormalized derivatives in the anisotropic scale-space.  This extension allows us to directly analyze the anisotropic (ellipsoidal) shape of local structures.  The main conclusions are (i) the norm of the -and -normalized anisotropic scale-space derivatives with a constant =1/2 are maximized regardless of the signal's dimension iff the analysis scale matrix is equal to the signal's covariance and (ii) the most-stable-over-scales criterion with the isotropic scale-space outperforms the maximum-over-scales criterion in the presence of noise.  Experiments with 1D and 2D synthetic data confirm the above findings.  3D implementations of the most-stable-over-scales methods are applied to the problem of estimating anisotropic spreads of pulmonary tumors shown in high-resolution computedtomography (HRCT) images.  Comparison of the first- and second-order methods shows the advantage of exploiting the second-order information.
