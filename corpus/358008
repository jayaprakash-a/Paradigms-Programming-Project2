SEQUENTIAL MCMC FOR BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION
 ABSTRACT In this paper, we address the problem of sequential Bayesian model selection.  This problem does not usually admit any closed-form analytical solution.  We propose here an original sequential simulation-based method to solve the associated Bayesian computational problems.  This method combines sequential importance sampling, a resampling procedure and reversible jump MCMC moves.  We describe a generic algorithm and then apply it to the problem of sequential Bayesian model order estimation of autoregressive (AR) time series observed in additive noise.
