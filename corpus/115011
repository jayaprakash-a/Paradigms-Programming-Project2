Receptive field formation in natural scene environments: comparison of kurtosis, skewness, and the quadratic form of BCM
 Abstract We study several statistically and biologically motivated learning rules using the same visual environment and neuronal architecture.  This allows us to concentrate on the feature extraction and neuronal coding properties of these rules.  We find that the quadratic form of the BCM rule behaves in a manner similar to a kurtosis maximization rule when the distribution contains kurtotic directions, although the BCM modification equations are computationally simpler.
