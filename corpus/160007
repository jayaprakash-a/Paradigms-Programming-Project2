Ionic Mechanisms in the Generation of Subthreshold Oscillations and Action Potential Clustering in Entorhinal Layer II Stellate Neurons
 ABSTRACT: A multicompartmental biophysical model of entorhinal cortex layer II stellate cells was developed to analyze the ionic basis of physiological properties, such as subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, action potential clustering, and the medium afterhyperpolarization.  In particular, the simulation illustrates the interaction of the persistent sodium current (I NaP ) and the hyperpolarization activated inward current (I h )inthe generation of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations.  The potential role of I h in contributing to the medium hyperpolarization (mAHP) and rebound spiking was studied.  The role of I h and the slow calcium-activated potassium current I K(AHP) in action potential clustering was also studied.  Representations of I h and I NaP were developed with parameters based on voltage-clamp data from whole-cell patch and single channel recordings of stellate cells (Dickson et al. ,
