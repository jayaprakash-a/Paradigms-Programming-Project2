Scalable Kernel Systems
 Abstract.  Kernel-based systems are currently very popular approaches to supervised learning.  Unfortunately, the computational load for training kernel-based systems increases drastically with the number of training data points.  Recently, a number of approximate methods for scaling kernel-based systems to large data sets have been introduced.  In this paper we investigate the relationship between three of those approaches and compare their performances experimentally.
