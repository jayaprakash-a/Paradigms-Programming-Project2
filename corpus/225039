Optimizing Local Probability Models for Statistical Parsing
 Abstract.  This paper studies the properties and performance of models for estimating local probability distributions which are used as components of larger probabilistic systems --- history-based generative parsing models.  We report experimental results showing that memory-based learning outperforms many commonly used methods for this task (
