Primitives, Perceptual Organization and Object Recognition
 Abstract: We argue that any computational theory of object recognition should explain how to decide what is to be recognized and how to recognize objects at the level of abstract categories.  We show that several current theories perform poorly by these criteria and propose that object representation must be in terms of the spatial relationships between stylized primitives, while the fundamental process of recognition is to assemble these primitives from image evidence, a version of perceptual organization.  We illustrate our approach with programs aimed at finding people and horses in pictures, and discuss the role of learning in the corresponding recognition process.  ``I am not asking what it appears to be doing.  I asked if it was smoking. " ``Appearances are not held to be a clue to the truth," said his cousin.  "But we seem to have no other.
