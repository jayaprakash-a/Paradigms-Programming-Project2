A Spatio-Temporal Data Model for Analyzing the Relationship between Property Ownership Changes, Land-Use/Land-Cover and Carbon Dynamics
 ABSTRACT Since 1980 there has been an increasing interest, both commercially and academically, in the development of spatio-temporal data models.  Such data models are designed not only to facilitate information extraction about data objects and the relationships between these objects but also to support the analysis of data in a time series from varying perspectives.  We will design a spatio-temporal data model for a NASA-funded research project.  This project investigates how land ownership practices and land-use/land-cover, influence changes in carbon storage dynamics in forested ecosystems in the southeastern United States.  The design of such a model will determine to what extent ownership changes have affected land-use/land-cover and whether these changes have in turn influenced carbon dynamics over the past 25 years.
