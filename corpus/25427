Estimation of Voice Source and Vocal Tract Characteristics Based on Multi-frame Analysis
 Abstract This paper presents a new approach for estimating voice source and vocal tract filter characteristics of voiced speech.  When it is required to know the transfer function of a system in signal processing, the input and output of the system are experimentally observed and used to calculate the function.  However, in the case of source-filter separation we deal with in this paper, only the output (speech) is observed and the characteristics of the system (vocal tract) and the input (voice source) must simultaneously be estimated.  Hence the estimate becomes extremely difficult, and it is usually solved approximately using oversimplified models.  We demonstrate that these characteristics are separable under the assumption that they are independently controlled by different factors.  The separation is realised using an iterative approximation along with the Multi-frame Analysis method, which we have proposed to find spectral envelopes of voiced speech with minimum interference of the harmonic structure.
