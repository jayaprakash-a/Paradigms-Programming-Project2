Geophysics in Object-Oriented Numerics (GOON): An informal conference
 ABSTRACT We held an open and informal conference at SEP attempting to facilitate cooperation in introducing Object Oriented computational techniques among workers in Geophysics.  Java seems attractive for the next century.  For the remainder of this century a wide variety of language combination options were considered and many opinions were expressed.  A few who stayed longest at the conference (perhaps the most dedicated to cooperation) developed a linkage of the Gockenbach-Symes HCL (Hilbert Class Library) in C++ to Fortran 90.  PREFACE We held a "Workshop on object-oriented numerics and reproducible research in computational geophysics
