Spatiotemporal Abstraction of Stochastic Sequential Processes
 Abstract.  Probabilistic finite state machines have become a popular modeling tool for representing sequential processes, ranging from images and speech signals to text documents and spatial and genomic maps.  In this paper, I describe two hierarchical abstraction mechanisms for simplifying the (estimation) learning and (control) optimization of complex Markov processes: spatial decomposition and temporal aggregation.  I present several approaches to combining spatial and temporal abstraction, drawing upon recent work of my group as well as that of others.  I show how spatiotemporal abstraction enables improved solutions to three dicult sequential estimation and decision problems: hidden state modeling and control, learning parallel plans, and coordinating with multiple agents.
