Mixture of Trajectory Models for Neural Decoding of Goal-Directed Movements
 Abstract Probabilistic techniques have been fruitfully applied to decoding physical parameters, such as arm trajectories or the position of a freely-foraging rat, from neural data.  Current trajectory models assume little or no knowledge about the direction or form of movement, but rather provide a basic smoothness constraint on the decoded trajectory.  When trajectories are goal-directed however, stronger models can be defined that reflect the typical kinematics of movement, as well as the discrete set of goal locations.  We present a mixture of trajectory models (MTM) framework that can be used with many current probabilistic decoding techniques, including the Bayes' Filter, particle filters, and Kalman filter variants.  This framework is applied to decoding arm trajectories in a center-out delayed reach task.  Neural activity was recorded using a 96-electrode array in premotor cortex of a rhesus macaque.  We found that a MTM gives 40% lower root-mean-square position error than a single trajectory model that knows little about the direction or form of the actual movements.  Using delay period neural activity to define a prior over the goal locations further improves decode performance.
