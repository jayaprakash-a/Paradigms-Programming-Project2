Fast Connected Components Algorithms for the EREW PRAM
 Abstract We present fast and efficient parallel algorithms for finding the connected components of an undirected graph.  These algorithms run on the exclusive-read, exclusive-write (EREW) PRAM.  On a graph with n vertices and m edges, our randomized algorithm runs in O(log n) time using (m+n 1+ffl )= log n EREW processors (for any fixed ffl ? 0).  A variant uses (m+n)= log n processors and runs in O(log n log log n) time.  A deterministic version of the algorithm runs in O(log 1:5 n) time using m+ n EREW processors.
