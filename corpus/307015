Normalized Cuts for Spinal MRI Segmentation
 Abstract Segmentation of bony structures plays an important role in image guided surgery of the spine.  In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to the segmentation of vertebral bodies from 2D sagittal magnetic resonance images of the spine.  We have applied Normalized Cuts with the Nystrm approximation method to MR sagittal images of the spine taking windowed histograms of intensity or textons as the most promising features.  Both, Normalized cuts and the Nystrm approximation method have shown to be a powerful segmentation technique in different fields, but its usefulness in the medical imaging environment has not been shown yet.  Results in T1 high-resolution images of the spine have been encouraging to pursue further research in this difficult task.
