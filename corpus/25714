Recovering Object Surfaces from Viewed Changes in Surface Texture Patterns
 Abstract This paper explores the reconstruction of object surfaces from viewed changes in surface texture patterns.  Our approach differs from those in the past in that instead of simply producing local estimates of the surface orientation, our algorithm recovers complete surfaces.  Past approaches [1, 16, 4, 9, 8, 11] only found the surface orientation locally and, therefore, did not take advantage of the surface integrability constraint.  Unlike [16, 7, 3], our algorithm does not assume that the surface texture pattern is isotropic; and unlike [14, 13
