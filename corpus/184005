A CASE STUDY WHERE BIOLOGY INSPIRED A SOLUTION TO A COMPUTER SCIENCE PROBLEM
 ABSTRACT This paper describes how the biological theory of gene duplication described in Susumu Ohno's provocative book, Evolution by Means of Gene Duplication, was brought to bear on a vexatious problem from the domain of automated machine learning, namely the problem of architecture discovery.  Six new architecture-altering operations for genetic programming were motivated by the way that new biological structures, functions, and behaviors arise in nature using gene duplication.  Genetic programming with the new architecture-altering operations was then applied to the transmembrane protein segment identification problem.  The out-of-sample error rate for the best genetically-evolved program achieved was slightly better than that of previously-reported human-written algorithms for this problem.
