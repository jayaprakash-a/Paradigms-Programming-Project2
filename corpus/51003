Shape-Based Recognition of Wiry Objects
 Abstract We present an approach to the recognition of complexshaped objects in cluttered environments based on edge cues.  We first use example images of the desired object in typical backgrounds to train a classifier cascade which determines whether edge pixels in an image belong to an instance of the object or the clutter.  Presented with a novel image, we use the cascade to discard clutter edge pixels.  The features used for this classification are localized, sparse edge density operations.  Experiments validate the effectiveness of the technique for recognition of complex objects in cluttered indoor scenes under arbitrary out-of-image-plane rotation.  1
