Spotting Neural Spike Patterns via Decomposition Into Types
 Abstract Detecting a specific stochastic pattern embedded in an unknown background noise is a difficult pattern recognition problem.  A similar problem appears when trying to detect a multi-neural spike pattern in a single electrical recording, embedded in the complex cortical activity of a behaving animal.  The technical difficulty of this detection is due to the lack of a good statistical model for the background activity, which is rapidly changing with the recording conditions and activity of the animal.  By employing a "type-based" information theoretic approach we introduce a new method for detecting patterns of non-homogeneous Poisson processes.  The main idea is a decomposition of the log-likelihood distribution according to "types" of the empirical counts.  This amounts to the assumption that the background activity has equal probability to contain all permutations of the required pattern.  We demonstrate the application of this method for detection the "reward" patterns in the Basal-Ganglia of behaving monkeys, yielding some unexpected biological results.
