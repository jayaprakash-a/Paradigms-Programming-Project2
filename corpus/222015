Classification Using Phi-Machines and Constructive Function Approximation
 Abstract The new classification algorithm CLEF combines a version of a linear machine known as a \Phi-machine with a non-linear function approximator that constructs its own features.  The algorithm finds non-linear decision boundaries by constructing features that are needed to learn the necessary discriminant functions.  The CLEF algorithm is proven to separate all consistently labelled training instances, even when they are not linearly separable in the input variables.  The algorithm is illustrated on a variety of tasks.
