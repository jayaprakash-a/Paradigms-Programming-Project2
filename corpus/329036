Class-Based Grouping in Perspective Images
 Abstract A major issue for object recognition systems is the organization of object structure and separation of individual objects within an image of a complex scene.  This paper demonstrates that general geometric object classes can be defined which provide effective constraints for grouping image features into coherent object boundaries.  These classes also support the computation of 3D invariant descriptions including symmetry axes, canonical coordinate frames and projective signatures.  The key idea is that a 3D geometric class defines relations which must hold between points on the image outline (the perspective projection of the object's surface).  The resulting image constraints enable both identification and grouping of image features belonging to objects of that class.  The classes include surfaces of revolution, canal surfaces (pipes) and polyhedra.  Recognition proceeds by first recognising an object as belonging to one of the classes (for example a surface of revolution) and subsequently classifying the object (for example as a particular vase).  This differs from conventional object recognition systems where recognition is generally targetted at particular objects.  The constraints and grouping methods are viewpoint invariant, and proceed with no information on object pose.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this class-based grouping on real, cluttered scenes using grouping algorithms developed for canal-surfaces, rotationally symmetric surfaces and polyhedra.
