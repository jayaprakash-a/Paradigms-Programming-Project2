Evolving Sorting Networks using Genetic Programming and Rapidly Reconfigurable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
 ABSTRACT This paper describes ongoing work involving the use of the Xilinx XC6216 rapidly reconfigurable fieldprogrammable gate array to evolve sorting networks using genetic programming.  We successfully evolved a network for sorting seven items that employs two fewer steps than the sorting network described in a l962 patent and that has the same number of steps as the seven-sorter devised by Floyd and Knuth subsequent to the patent.
