Inference and Learning in Hybrid Bayesian Networks
 Abstract We survey the literature on methods for inference and learning in Bayesian Networks composed of discrete and continuous nodes, in which the continuous nodes have a multivariate Gaussian distribution, whose mean and variance depends on the values of the discrete nodes.  We also briefly consider hybrid Dynamic Bayesian Networks, an extension of switching Kalman filters.  This report is meant to summarize what is known at a sucient level of detail to enable someone to implement the algorithms, but without dwelling on formalities.  1 1 Update The algorithm described in this report, due to [Lau92] (see also [CDLS99, ch.  7]), has been implemented as part of my Bayes Net Toolbox 2 .  However, it can be numerically unstable.  A different algorithm, which fixes this problem, is described in [LJ99].  Other references to more recent material have also been added where appropriate.
