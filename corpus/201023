Multicategory Discrimination via Linear Programming
 Abstract A single linear program is proposed for discriminating between the elements of k disjoint point sets in the n-dimensional real space R n : When the conical hulls of the k sets are (k\Gamma 1)-point disjoint in R n+1 , a k-piece piecewise-linear surface generated by the linear program completely separates the k sets.  This improves on a previous linear programming approach which required that each set be linearly separable from the remaining k \Gamma 1 sets.  When the conical hulls of the k sets are not (k \Gamma 1)-point disjoint, the proposed linear program generates an error-minimizing piecewise-linear separator for the k sets.  For this case it is shown that the null solution is never a unique solver of the linear program and occurs only under the rather rare condition when the mean of each point set equals the mean of the means of the other k \Gamma 1 sets.  This makes the proposed linear computational programming formulation useful for approximately discriminating between k sets that are not piecewise-linear separable.  Computational results are reported for three previously available databases.
