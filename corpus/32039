Automatic 3D-Graph Construction of Nerve Cells from Confocal Microscopy Scans
 Abstract We present a method of automatic graph construction for the description of the geometric structure of nerve cells from 3D confocal scans.  The method is tracing the branch center points, in the branch axial direction using as hints the location of difficult regions inside the neuronal branches.  The axes were obtained in previous work by computing pairwise vector products of intersecting gradients associated to across-scales validated boundary edge points of the neuronal branches.  The axes' anchor points are the branch center points which are estimated as the "center of mass" of all intersecting gradient end points.  The difficult regions are the axes' anchor points having a high directional variance of vector products contributing to the associated ax.  The presented algorithm which uses all the information obtained from preprocessing, is robust to variable contrast, little sensitive to boundary irregularities, adaptive to variability of branch geometry, and produces a sparse, topology preserving graph of the neuron under investigation.  A subsequent surface reconstruction based on this graph [21] accompanied by the labeling of the graph with geometric measurements, would be feasible.
