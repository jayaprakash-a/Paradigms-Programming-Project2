Model Averaging with Discrete Bayesian Network Classifiers
 Abstract This paper considers the problem of performing classification by model-averaging over a class of discrete Bayesian network structures consistent with a partial ordering and with bounded in-degree k.  We show that for N nodes this class contains in the worst-case at least -( N/2 k N/2 ) distinct network structures, but we show that this summation can be performed in O( N k N) time.  We use this fact to show that it is possible to eciently construct a single directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose predictions approximate those of exact model-averaging over this class, allowing approximate model-averaged predictions to be performed in O(N) time.  We evaluate the procedure in a supervised classification context, and show empirically that this technique can be beneficial for classification even when the generating distribution is not a member of the class being averaged over, and we characterize the performance over several parameters on simulated and real-world data.
