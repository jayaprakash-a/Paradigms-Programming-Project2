Rotational Invariants for Wide-baseline Stereo #
 Abstract The problem of establishing correspondences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints, i. e.  the "wide-baseline stereo" problem, is studied in the paper.  To handle the problem of affine distortion between two corresponding regions a method based on rotational invariants computed on normalised measurement regions is applied.  A robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is used.  The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions, some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the distinguished region, may be used to establish tentative correspondences.
