On the Extensions of Kernel Alignment
 Abstract In this paper we address the problem of measuring the degree of agreement between a kernel and a learning task.  The quantity that we use to capture this notion is alignment (Cristianini et al. , 2001a).  We motivate its theoretical properties, and derive a series of algorithms for adapting a kernel in two important machine learning problems: regression and classification with uneven datasets.  We also propose a novel inductive algorithm within the framework of kernel alignment that can be used for kernel combination and kernel selection.  The algorithms presented have been tested on both artificial and realworld datasets.
