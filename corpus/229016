Using robotics to fold proteins and dock ligands
 Abstract The problems of protein folding and ligand docking have been explored largely using molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods.  These methods are very compute intensive because they often explore a much wider range of energies, conformations and time than necessary.  In addition, Monte Carlo methods often get trapped in local minima.  We initially showed that robotic motion planning permitted one to determine the energy of binding and dissociation of ligands from protein binding sites (Singh et al. , 1999).  The robotic motion planning method maps complicated three-dimensional conformational states into a much simpler, but higher dimensional space in which conformational rearrangements can be represented as linear paths.  The dimensionality of the conformation space is of the same order as the number of degrees of conformational freedom in three-dimensional space.  We were able to determine the relative energy of association and dissociation of a ligand to a protein by calculating the energetics of interaction for a few thousand conformational states in the vicinity of the protein and choosing the best path from the roadmap.  More recently, we have applied roadmap planning to the problem of protein folding (Apaydin et al. , 2002a).  We represented multiple conformations of a protein as nodes in a compact graph with the edges representing the probability of moving between neighboring states.  Instead of using Monte Carlo simulation to simulate thousands of possible paths through various conformational states, we were able to use Markov methods to calculate the steady state occupancy of each conformation, needing to calculate the energy of each conformation
