A Resampling Approach to Cluster Validation
 Abstract.  The concept of cluster stability is introduced as a means for assessing the validity of data partitionings found by clustering algorithms.  It allows us to explicitly quantify the quality of a clustering solution, without being dependent on external information.  The principle of maximizing the cluster stability can be interpreted as choosing the most self-consistent data partitioning.  We present an empirical estimator for the theoretically derived stability index, based on imitating independent sample-sets by way of resampling.  Experiments on both toy-examples and real-world problems effectively demonstrate that the proposed validation principle is highly suited for model selection.
