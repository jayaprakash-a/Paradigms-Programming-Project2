Bayesian Correlation
 Abstract Cross-correlation is a commonly used principle for intensity-based object localization and consists of two conceptual components, one very effective and the other rather weak.  The effective component is the inner-product score for matching.  The weak component is exhaustive search, inefficient in two dimensions, and infeasible in the higher dimensioned configuration spaces needed for matching object models.  The Bayesian framework for correlation, developed here, replaces exhaustive search with constrained, random hypothesis generation.  Achieving a synthesis of cross-correlation, which is deterministic, with probabilistic sampling has required several developments.  The first is the interpretation of correlation matching functions, in probabilistic terms, by constructing an observation likelihood.  Second, a response-learning algorithm is developed for the distributions of filter-bank responses.  Inescapably, response-learning demands statistical modelling of background intensities, and there are unexpected links here with image coding and Independent Component Analysis.  Lastly, multi-scale processing is well known to be an important component of conventional correlation.  In the Bayesian context it is achieved by means of a new algorithm, termed layered sampling, for which asymptotic properties are derived.  Bayesian correlation has the considerable advantage that, thanks to the response-learning, image-feature tuning and selection are automatic.  Combined with random sampling to deal with ambiguity, response-learning makes for excellent handling of image clutter, and this is demonstrated.  Furthermore, the output of Bayesian correlation is not simply an estimate of location but an entire probability distribution.  This allows sequential inference --- propagation from coarse to fine scale, and also propagation over time, illustrated here by examples of image-sequence analysis.
