IMPROVED SPEAKER SEGMENTATION AND SEGMENTS CLUSTERING USING THE BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION
 ABSTRACT Detection of speaker, channel and environmentchanges in a continuous audio stream is importantinvarious applications (e. g. , broadcast news, meetings/teleconferences etc. ).  Standard schemes for segmentation use a classifier and hence do not generalize to unseen speaker / channel / environments.  Recently S. Chen introduced new segmentation and clustering algorithms, using the so-called BIC.  This paper presents more accurate and more e#cientvariants of the BIC scheme for segmentation and clustering.  Specifically, the new algorithms improve the speed and accuracy of segmentation and clustering and allow for a real-time implementation of simultaneous transcription, segmentation and speaker tracking.
