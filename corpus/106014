JPEG Quality Transcoding Using Neural Networks Trained With a Perceptual Error Measure
 Abstract A JPEG Quality Transcoder (JQT) converts a JPEG image file that was encoded with low image quality to a larger JPEG image file with reduced visual artifacts, without access to the original uncompressed image.  In this paper, we describe technology for JQT design that takes a pattern recognition approach to the problem, using a database of gamma-corrected images to train statistical models of the artifacts introduced through JPEG compression.  In the training procedure for these models, we use a model of human visual perception as an error measure.  Our current prototype system removes 31. 2% of the artifacts introduced by moderate compression, as measured on an independent test image database using a perceptual metric; this improvement results in an average PSNR reduction of 0. 56 dB.
