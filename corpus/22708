Search for Leptoquark Bosons in ep Collisions at HERA
 Abstract A search for scalar and vector leptoquarks coupling to first generation fermions is performed using the e + p and e- p scattering data collected by the H1 experiment between 1994 and 2000.  The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 117 pb- 1 .  No evidence for the direct or indirect production of such particles is found in data samples with a large transverse momentum final state electron or with large missing transverse momentum.  Constraints on leptoquark models are established.  For leptoquark couplings of electromagnetic strength, leptoquarks with masses up to 275- 325 GeV are ruled out.  These limits improve and supercede earlier H1 limits based on subsamples of the data used here.
