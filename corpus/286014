Representations for Face Recognition by Independent Component Analysis
 Abstract A number of current face recognition algorithms find useful face representations using unsupervised statistical methods.  Typically these methods find a set of basis images and represent faces as a linear combination of those images.  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular example of such methods.  The basis images found by PCA depend only on on pairwise relationships between pixels in the image database.  In a task such as face recognition, in which important information may be contained in the high-order relationships among pixels, it seems reasonable to expect that better basis images may be found by methods sensitive to these high order statistics.  Independent component analysis (ICA), a generalization of PCA, is one such method.  We used a version of ICA derived from the principle of optimal information transfer through sigmoidal neurons [9].  ICA was performed on face images in the FERET database under two different architectures, one which treated the images as variables and the pixels as outcomes, and a second which treated the pixels as variables and the images as outcomes.  The first architecture found spatially local basis images for the faces.  The second architecture produced a factorial code for the faces.  Both ICA representations were superior to representations based on principal component analysis for recognizing faces across days and changes in expression.  A classifier that combined the two ICA representations gave the best performance.
