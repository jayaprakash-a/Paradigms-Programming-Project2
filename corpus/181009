Online Control Policy Optimization for Minimizing Map Uncertainty during Exploration
 Abstract--- Tremendous progress has been made recently in simultaneous localization and mapping of unknown environments.  Using sensor and odometry data from an exploring mobile robot, it has become much easier to build high-quality globally consistent maps of many large, real-world environments.  To date, however, relatively little attention has been paid to the controllers used to build these maps.  Existing exploration strategies usually attempt to cover the largest amount of unknown space as quickly as possible.  Few strategies exist for building the most reliable map possible, but the particular control strategy can have a substantial impact on the quality of the resulting map.  In this paper, we devise a control algorithm for exploring unknown space that explicitly tries to build as large a map as possible while maintaining as accurate a map as possible.  We make use of a parameterized class of spiral trajectory policies, choosing a new parameter setting at every time step to maximize the expected reward of the policy.  We do this in the context of building a visual map of an unknown environment, and show that our strategy leads to a higher accuracy map faster than other candidate controllers, including any single choice in our policy class.
