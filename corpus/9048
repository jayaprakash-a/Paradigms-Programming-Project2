An Advanced Integrated Architecture for Wireless Voicemail Data Retrieval
 Abstract This paper describes an alternative architecture for voicemail data retrieval on the move.  It is comprised of three distinct components: a speech recognizer, a text summarizer and a WAP Push Service initiator, enabling mobile users to receive text summaries of their voicemail in realtime without an explicit request.  Our approach overcomes the cost and usability limitations of the conventional voicemail retrieval paradigm which requires a connection establishment in order to listen to spoken messages.  We report performance results on all different components of the system that has been trained and tested on a database containing 1843 North American English messages as well as on the duration of the corresponding data path.  The proposed architecture can be further customized to meet the requirements of a complete voicemail value-added service.
