Multi-view Stereo Reconstruction of Dense Shape and Complex Appearance
 Abstract We address the problem of estimating the three-dimensional shape and complex appearance of a scene from a calibrated set of views under fixed illumination.  Our approach relies on an affine subspace constraint that must be satisfied when the scene exhibits "diffuse + specular" reflectance characteristics.  This constraint is used to define a cost functional for the discrepancy between the measured images and those generated by the estimate of the scene, rather than attempting to match image-to-image directly.  Minimizing such a functional yields the optimal estimate of the shape of the scene, represented by a dense surface, as well as its radiance, represented by three functions defined on such a surface.  These can be used to generate novel views that capture the non-Lambertian appearance of the scene.
