LAFTER: Lips and Face Real-Time Tracker
 Abstract This paper describes an active-camera real-time system for tracking, shape description, and classification of the human face and mouth using only an SGI Indy computer.  The system is based on use of 2-D blob features, which are spatially-compact clusters of pixels that are similar in terms of low-level image properties.  Patterns of behavior (e. g. , facial expressions and head movements) can be classified in real-time using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) methods.  The system has been tested on hundreds of users and has demonstrated extremely reliable and accurate performance.  Typical classification accuracies are near 100%.
