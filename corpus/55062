Team-Maxmin Equilibria
 In a noncooperative game, a team is a set of players that have identical payoffs.  We investigate zero-sum games where a team of several players plays against a single adversary.  The team is not regarded as a single player because the team members might not be able to coordinate their actions.  In such a game, a certain equilibrium can be selected naturally: the team-maxmin equilibrium.  It assures the team players the best payoff they can hope for, given their inability to coordinate.  A team-maxmin equilibrium exists, and in a generic game it is unique.  Journal of Economic Literature Classification Number: C72.
