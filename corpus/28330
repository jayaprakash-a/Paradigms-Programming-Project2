Optimizing the Layout of a Complete Tree
 Abstract.  Tree-like organizations are a fundamental parallel processing structure.  The layout of trees has so far been studied mostly for trees of degree four or less.  In this article, we give tight upper and lower bounds on the total wire length of complete m-ary trees (m # 2) on a twodimensional grid if the leaves are constraint to lie on a grid line.  For the case of m = 2 we reproof an older result of [5] in a more direct way.  The construction results in a significant reduction of the total wire length compared to the obvious \symmetric" layout.
