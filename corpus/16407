Secure Authentication Schemes suitable for an Associative Memory Leibniz Center for Research in Computer Science Technical Report 2004-30
 Abstract Most security protocols are designed to secure the interaction between computers.  User authentication, an interaction between a computer and a human, merits a different approach since human memory is fundamentally associative.  We describe here a secure authentication protocol which relies on picture recognition, a skill which people find relatively easy.  The human and the computer share a secret, which is a set of 60-100 pictures.  Authentication is done via a challenge-response protocol: the computer poses a sequence of challenges to the user, which can only be answered correctly by someone who knows the shared secret.  Once the probability of random guessing goes below a fixed threshold, the computer authenticates the user.  We report user studies showing that the protocol is feasible for humans to use, with high reliably and for a long period of time.  We also describe probabilistic attacks on the protocol, which demonstrate the protocol's computational merits and limitations.
