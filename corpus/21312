Generalized types of synchronization in networks of spiking neurons
 Abstract The synchronization of neural signals has been proposed as a temporal coding scheme in distributed cortical networks.  Theoretical studies in that direction mainly focused on the synchronization of coupled oscillatory subsystems.  In the present work we show that several complex types of synchronization previously described for graded response neurons appear similarly also in biologically realistic networks of spiking and compartmental neurons.  This includes synchronized complex spatio-temporal behavior, partial and generalized synchronization.  The results suggest a similarly rich spatio-temporal behavior in real neural systems and may guide experimental research towards the study of complex modes of synchronization and their neuromodulation.
