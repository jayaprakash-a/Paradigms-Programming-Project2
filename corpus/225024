Rethinking Text Segmentation Models: An Information Extraction Case Study
 Abstract I examine the use of text segmentation methods on semi-structured text within an information extraction application, arguing that: hierarchical models of discourse structure are necessary, that discourse relationships are not, that repetition can indicate cohesion or a topic change, and that generalized cue phrases are underutilized.  I present results and discussion of the evaluation of two models.  This paper discusses one aspect of an information extraction system for real estate classified ads: how to handle advertisements that advertise multiple properties.  Examples of such advertisements appear in Figures 1 and 2.  The system described is in production use.  1 The contributions of this paper include: # Drawing connections and contrasts between approaches to segmentation within the information extraction literature and the related literature on text segmentation # Questioning the utility { for even practical `language engineering' purposes { of linear segmentations of texts # Showing that the notion of topic, used as a criterion for segmentation, has not been well defined # Arguing that, for important practical notions of topic, the lexical cohesion metrics most commonly used for text segmentation do not give the desired results and one often wants repulsion sion # Reasserting the importance of using a generalized notion of cue phrases 1 It runs in the background of
