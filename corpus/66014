Locating Transcription Factors Binding Sites Using a Variable Memory Markov Model
 Abstract We propose a novel method for locating transcription factors binding sites in upstream regions, by employing a variable memory Markov model (VMM) based feature selection method.  Using this method we find a set of features which discriminate well between genes upstream sequences and random sequences, and give each feature a score based on its discriminatory power.  We predict that regions in which high-scoring features are abundant, will be well correlated with transcription factors' binding sites.  We propose a rather strict benchmark for comparing such predictions with known Data.  Rather than look for consensus sequences, we go over the upstream sequences (of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae), where some binding sites are known (according to the SCPD), and try to find these sites.  Our results are consistently and significantly better than random, and are comparable with those one gets when using MatInspector to make such prediction.  MatInspector is a software that looks for specified consensus pattern in a DNA sequence.  In contrast with it, our method is completely unsupervised and does not require any prior knowledge about the data.
