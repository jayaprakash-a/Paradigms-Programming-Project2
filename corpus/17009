A PHYSICALLY-BASED MODEL OF OCEAN BACKSCATTER FOR WIND SPEED RETRIEVAL FROM SAR, SCATTEROMETER AND ALTIMETER
 ABSTRACT A comprehensive theoretical model of radar backscatter from the ocean surface is discussed.  It combines alternative models of the interaction between the wind and the sea surface, and different descriptions of the ocean waveheight spectrum of wind seas, with two alternative scattering theories, namely the composite-surface model and the integral equation method.  The effects of swell, limited fetch, and perturbations due to rain, surface slicks and currents may be included.  The model is able to show the expected sensitivity of radar backscatter to all these factors, and some results for the dependence on swell are shown.  Hence it indicates possible improvements to current empirical models as well as implications for future missions such as Envisat.  The model predictions are also compared against Topex altimeter data which are collocated with buoy measurements, and against an empirical scatterometer model function.  The results at nadir agree well with the empirically observed dependence on wind speed, while the dependence on swell is consistent with recent studies of the influence of swell on the relation between wind stress and wind speed.  Results at off-nadir incidence angles are more sensitive to the choice of ocean waveheight spectrum.  In particular, the directional spread of waves is not well understood; this leads to a systematic discrepancy between dependences of backscatter on wind direction predicted by the empirical and theoretical models.
