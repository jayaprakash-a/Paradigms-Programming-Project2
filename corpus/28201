PrFQ: Probabilistic Fair Queuing
 Abstract--Packet scheduling constitutes the core problem in efficient fair allocation of bandwidth to competing flows.  To date, numerous algorithms for packet scheduling have been suggested and tested.  However, only a few of them are currently deployed.  One of the key reasons for rarity of applied packet scheduling methods lies in the complexity of their implementation.  In this paper we describe and experiment with a family of randomized algorithms for packet scheduling.  The algorithms we present are simple to implement and require small amounts of computation time.  Specifically, we present an O(1) probabilistic weighted fair queuing algorithm that emits packets from flows with an improved delay jitter.  We present experimental results with the proposed randomized algorithms which suggest that the algorithms may form a vailable alternative to the currently deployed deterministic fair queuing algorithms.
