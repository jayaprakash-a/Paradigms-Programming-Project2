RANDOM FINITE SETS AND SEQUENTIAL MONTE CARLO METHODS IN MULTI-TARGET TRACKING
 ABSTRACT Random finite set provides a rigorous foundation for optimal Bayes multi-target filtering.  The major hurdle faced in Bayes multi-target filtering is the inherent computational intractability.  Even the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, which propagates only the first moment (or PHD) instead of the full multi-target posterior, still involves multiple integrals with no closed forms.  In this paper, we highlight the relationship between Radon-Nikodym derivative and set derivative of random finite sets that enables a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) implementation of the optimal multitarget filter.  In addition, a generalised SMC method to implement the PHD filter is also presented.  The SMC PHD filter has an attractive feature-its computational complexity is independent of the (time-varying) number of targets.
