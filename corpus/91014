A Split-Merge Markov Chain Monte Carlo Procedure for the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
 Abstract.  We propose a split-merge Markov chain algorithm to address the problem of inefficient sampling for conjugate Dirichlet process mixture models.  Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian mixture models, such as Gibbs sampling, can become trapped in isolated modes corresponding to an inappropriate clustering of data points.  This article describes a Metropolis-Hastings procedure that can escape such local modes by splitting or merging mixture components.  Our Metropolis-Hastings algorithm employs a new technique in which an appropriate proposal for splitting or merging components is obtained by using a restricted Gibbs sampling scan.  We demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms the Gibbs sampler in situations where two or more components are similar in structure.
