Instantiating deformable models with a neural net
 Abstract Deformable models are an attractive approach to recognizing objects which have considerable within-class variability such as handwritten characters.  However, there are severe search problems associated with fitting the models to data which could be reduced if a better starting point for the search were available.  We show that by training a neural network to predict how a deformable model should be instantiated from an input image, such improved starting points can be obtained.  This method has been implemented for a system that recognizes handwritten digits using deformable models, and the results show that the search time can be significantly reduced without compromising recognition performance.
