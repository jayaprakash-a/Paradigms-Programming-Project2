IMPROVING INTONATIONAL PHRASING WITH SYNTACTIC INFORMATION
 ABSTRACT The prediction of intonational phrase boundaries from raw text is an important step for a text-to-speech system: Locating where to place short pauses enables more natural sounding speech, that can be more easily understood.  We improved upon earlier work [Hirschberg and Prieto, 1996] by adding syntactic information gained from a highaccuracy parser [Collins, 1999].  We report significant improvement using various experimental setups.  We also show that our improved method comes close to interannotator agreement.
