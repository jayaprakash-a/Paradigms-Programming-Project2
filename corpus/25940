A Multi-Agent System for Agent Coordination in Uncertain Environments
 ABSTRACT We present a multi-agent architecture for coordinating large numbers of mobile agents (e. g.  robots) cooperating in uncertain environments.  Our approach addresses the problem of navigating large numbers of goal-driven agents through an environment whose state is unknown and has to be discovered during navigation.  In our approach, each agent uses an approximate POMDP planner for generating contingency plans, and an efficient control brokering scheme for dispatching agents to goal locations.  Extensive experimental results have been obtained in the context of natural disaster relief.  Our experiments have been carried out in a realistic simulation of Honduras after Hurricane Mitch destroyed most of the country's infrastructure.
