Finding Topics in Dynamical Text: Application to Chat Line Discussions
 ABSTRACT The problem of analysing dynamically evolving textual data has recently arisen.  An example of such data is the discussion appearing in Internet chat lines.  In this paper a recently introduced method, termed complexity pursuit, is used to extract the topics of a dynamical chat line discussion.  Experimental results demonstrate that meaningful topics can be found and also suggest the applicability of the method to query-based retrieval from a temporally changing text stream.
