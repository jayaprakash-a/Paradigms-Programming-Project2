Birth-death MCMC methods for mixtures with an unknown number of components
 Abstract Mixture models have very wide application.  However, the problem of determining the number of components, K say, is one of the challenging problems in this area.  There are several approaches in the literature for testing K for di#erentvalues.  A recent alternative approach is to treat K as unknown, and to model K and the mixture component parameters jointly; see for example Richardson and Green (1997).  In this paper, we propose an approach based on a birth-death process.  In contrast with the approach in Stephens(2000), we make use of the latent indicators so that the approach can be used to solve the problems with missing data when calculation of the likelihood requires knowledge of the unobservable latent variables.  Speci#cally,we use the method to analyse hidden Markov models with unknown numbers of states.  The model and the algorithm are illustrated by some real examples.
