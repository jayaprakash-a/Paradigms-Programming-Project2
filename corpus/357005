The Power of Sampling in Knowledge Discovery
 FIN-00014 University of Helsinki, Finland E-mail: fjkivinen, mannilag@cs. Helsinki. FI Report C-1993-66, December 1993, 18 pages Abstract We consider the problem of approximately verifying the truth of sentences of tuple relational calculus in a given relation M by considering only a random sample of M .  We define two different measures for the error of a universal sentence in a relation.  For a set of n universal sentences each with at most k universal quantifiers, we give upper and lower bounds for the sample sizes required for having a high probability that all the sentences with error at least '' can be detected as false by considering the sample.  The sample sizes are O((ln n)=") or O((jM j 1\Gamma 1=k ln n)="), depending on the error measure used.  We also consider universal-existential sentences.
