Agnostic PAC-Learning of Functions on Analog Neural Nets
 Abstract We consider learning on multi-layer neural nets with piecewise polynomial activation functions and a fixed number k of analog inputs.  We exhibit arbitrarily powerful network architectures for which efficient and provably successful learning algorithms exist in the rather realistic refinement of Valiant's model for probably approximately correct learning ("PAC-learning") where no a-priori assumptions are required about the "target function" (agnostic learning), arbitrary noise is permitted in the training sample, and the target outputs as well as the network outputs may be arbitrary reals.  The number of computation steps of the learning algorithm LEARN that we construct is bounded by a polynomial in the bit-length n of the fixed number of input variables, in the bound s for the allowed bit-length of weights, and in 1 '' , where '' is some arbitrary given bound for the true error of the neural net after training and for the probability that the learning algorithm fails for a randomly drawn training sample.
