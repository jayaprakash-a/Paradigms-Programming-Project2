A Learning Analog Neural Network Chip with Continuous-Time Recurrent Dynamics
 Abstract We present experimental results on supervised learning of dynamical features in an analog VLSI neural network chip.  The recurrent network, containing six continuous-time analog neurons and 42 free parameters (connection strengths and thresholds), is trained to generate time-varying outputs approximating given periodic signals presented to the network.  The chip implements a stochastic perturbative algorithm, which observes the error gradient along random directions in the parameter space for error-descent learning.  In addition to the integrated learning functions and the generation of pseudo-random perturbations, the chip provides for teacher forcing and long-term storage of the volatile parameters.  The network learns a 1 kHz circular trajectory in 100 sec.  The chip occupies 2mm \Theta 2mm in a 2m CMOS process, and dissipates 1:2 mW.
