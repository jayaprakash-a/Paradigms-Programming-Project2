Variational Learning for Multi-Layer Networks of Linear Threshold Units
 Abstract Linear threshold units (LTUs) were originally proposed as models of biological neurons.  They were widely studied in the context of the perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1962).  Due to the diculties of finding a general algorithm for networks with hidden nodes, they never passed into general use.  In this work we derive an algorithm in the context of a probabilistic models and show how it may be applied in multi-layer networks of linear threshold units.  We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on three data-sets.
