Factored Particles for Scalable Monitoring
 Abstract Exact monitoring in dynamic Bayesian networks is intractable, so approximate algorithms are necessary.  This paper presents a new family of approximate monitoring algorithms that combine the best qualities of the particle filtering and Boyen-Koller methods.  Our algorithms maintain an approximate representation the belief state in the form of sets of factored particles, that correspond to samples of clusters of state variables.  Empirical results show that our algorithms outperform both ordinary particle filtering and the Boyen-Koller algorithm on large systems.
