Autonomous Vehicle Guidance Using Analog VLSI Neuromorphic Sensors
 Abstract.  Analog VLSI circuits implementing aspects of biological systems are attractive for the construction of compact low-power autonomous systems.  We describe such a system, consisting of a mobile robot equipped with a neuromorphic sensor implementing a one dimensional silicon retina.  Specifically, we demonstrate how the real-time visual pre-processing capabilities of the neuromorphic sensor are instrumental in enabling the system to reliably and autonomously track a continuous edge.  We present data both from the neuromorphic sensor and from the overall system, performing a line tracking task.
