Arbitrary Elastic Topologies and Ocular Dominance
 Abstract The elastic net, which has been used to produce accounts of the formation of topology preserving maps and ocular dominance columns (OD), embodies a nearest neighbour topology.  A Hebbian account of OD is not so restricted -- and indeed makes the prediction that the width of the columns depends on the nature of the (more general) neighbourhood relations.  Elastic and Hebbian accounts have recently been unified -- raising a question mark about their different determiners of column widths.  This paper considers this issue, and demonstrates theoretically that it is possible to use more general topologies in the elastic net, including those effectively adopted in the Hebbian model.
