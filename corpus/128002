Probability Assessment with Maximum Entropy in Bayesian Networks
 Abstract Bayesian networks are widely accepted as tools for probabilistic modeling in the medical domain.  In modeling Bayesian networks in collaboration with domain experts, the definition of the network structure is relatively easy.  The assessment of the conditional probability tables (CPT) is often a much more dicult task, even though there is a lot of statistical information available in the medical literature.  The problem is twofold.  In the first place it is usually not possible to use this information directly to fill in the CPTs.  In the second place, the information is usually insucient for a unique definition of the CPTs.  A standard approach to define a probabilistic model on the basis of insucient statistical information is to apply the Maximum Entropy Method (MaxEnt).  MaxEnt searches for the unique model that maximizes the entropy under the constraints that it satisfies the given statistical information.  In standard applications of MaxEnt for models defined by one joint probability table, these constraints are linear in the table entries.  However, if MaxEnt is applied to a Bayesian network, i. e.  the joint distribution is factorized into a product of CPTs, these constraints are typically nonlinear in the CPTs.  In this paper we show how these nonlinear constraints can be dealt with, and we describe an algorithm that (locally) maximizes entropy under constraints in Bayesian networks.  The method is illustrated by an example.
