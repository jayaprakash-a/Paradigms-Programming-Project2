Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian single and multiple comparison procedures
 Summary In classical statistics, the significance of comparisons (e. g. , ` 1\Gamma ` 2 ) is calibrated using the Type 1 error rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero, which makes no sense in many applications.  We set up a more relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or negative, and, based on the data, you can state "` 1 ? ` 2 with confidence," ``` 2 ? ` 1 with confidence," or "no claim with confidence. " We focus on the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim "` 1 ? ` 2 with confidence" when ` 2 ? ` 1 (or vice-versa).  We compute the Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian confidence statements and find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up to 50%).  Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the sense that claims based on 95% posterior intervals have Type S error rates between 0 and 2. 5%.  For multiple comparison situations, the conclusions are similar.
