Robust Structure and Motion from Outlines of Smooth Curved Surfaces
 Abstract: This article addresses the problem of estimating the motion of a camera as it observes the outline (or apparent contour) of a solid bounded by a smooth surface in successive image frames.  In this context, the surface points that project onto the apparent contour of an object depend on the viewpoint, and the only true correspondences between two outlines of the same object are the projections of frontier points where the viewing rays intersect in the tangent plane of the surface.  Given the apparent contours detected in an image sequence, a robust procedure is proposed for simultaneously estimating the camera configurations and a consistent subset of the frontier.  It uses the signature representation of the dual of image outlines to identify promising correspondences, and the redundancy of multi-view epipolar geometry to retain the consistent ones.  The visual hull of the observed solid is finally reconstructed from the recovered viewpoints.  The proposed approach is, in principle, applicable to orthographic, weak-perspective and arbitrary affine projection models, but its current implementation is limited to the orthographic case.  Experiments with nine real image sequences are presented, including a quantitative comparison of the recovered and ground-truth camera configurations for the six datasets for which the latter information is available, and sample visual hulls computed from all image sequences.
