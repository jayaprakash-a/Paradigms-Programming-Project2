An Instance-Based State Representation for Network Repair
 Abstract We describe a formal framework for diagnosis and repair problems that shares elements of the well known partially observable MDP and cost-sensitive classification models.  Our cost-sensitive fault remediation model is amenable to implementation as a reinforcementlearning system, and we describe an instance-based state representation that is compatible with learning and planning in this framework.  We demonstrate a system that uses these ideas to learn to efficiently restore network connectivity after a failure.
