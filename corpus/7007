Asymptotics of Efficiency Loss in Competitive Market Mechanisms
 Abstract--- We consider the loss of efficiency in competitive market mechanisms that were introduced by Kelly [Kel97].  We model a large heterogenous population by letting each user have a random utility function.  We show that if the utility functions are bounded, the competitive equilibrium will be as efficient as the social optimum with high probability as the number of users increases.  This is the case for both inelastic capacity as well as elastic capacity under some standard assumptions.  We extend this result to a network setup where sources and destinations are picked at random.  If, however, the utility functions are not bounded, the loss of efficiency does not converge to zero.  Collaborating simulation results are also presented.
