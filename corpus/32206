Learning with Cascade for Classification of Non-Convex Manifolds
 Abstract Images of a visual object, such as human face, reside in a complicated manifold in the high dimensional image space, when the object is subject to variations in pose, illumination, and other factors.  Viola and Jones [1, 2, 3] have successfully tackled difficult nonlinear classification problem for face detection using AdaBoost learning.  Moreover, their simple-to-complex cascade of classifiers structure makes the learning and classification even more effective.  While training with cascade has been used effectively in many works
