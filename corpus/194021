Performance Evaluation of the Multi-modal Neighbourhood Signature Method for Colour Object Recognition
 Abstract The proposed method represents object or image colour structure by features computed from neighbourhoods with multi-modal colour density function.  Stable invariants are derived from modes of colour density that are robustly estimated by the mean shift algorithm.  The problem of extracting local invariant colour features is addressed directly, without a need for prior segmentation or edge detection.  The signature is concise --- an image is typically represented by a few hundred bytes, a few thousands for very complex scenes.  We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on a standard colour object recognition task using a publicly available dataset.  Very good recognition performance (average match percentile 99. 5%) was achieved in real time (average 0. 28 seconds per match) which compares favourably with results reported in the literature.  The method has been shown to operate successfully under changing illumination, viewpoint, object pose, non-rigid deformation and partial occlusion.
