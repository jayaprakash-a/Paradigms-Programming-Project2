Face recognition: A literature survey
 Abstract As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years.  This is evidenced by the emergence of face recognition conferences such as AFGR [1] and AVBPA [2], and systematic empirical evaluations of face recognition techniques, including the FERET [3, 4, 5, 6] and XM2VTS [7] protocols.  There are at least two reasons for this trend; the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research.  This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research.
