Modelling the Occurrence of Large Concentration Values in Pollutant Plumes
 Abstract: Large concentration values are of particular interest in assessing hazards or nuisance associated with clouds or plumes of toxic, flammable or malodorous gases.  Previously we have used statistical extreme value theory to analyse the probability distribution of large concentrations at a fixed point in space.  Here we present a probabilistic model for the temporal occurrence (at a discrete set of points in space -- the receptor locations) of large concentrations in a plume.  We consider a fixed downwind distance, and take the plume centreline to be at one of a discrete set of crosswind positions.  Changes of centreline position are modelled by a continuous time Markov chain.  At each receptor location the large concentration values are taken to occur at the points of a Poisson process in time whose rate depends on the distance from the centreline.  We present some results from fitting this model to data from atmospheric point source experiments.  The fitted parameters for the Markov chain are not very robust or reliable.  Possible reasons for this are discussed, and suggestions are made for how the results might be improved.
