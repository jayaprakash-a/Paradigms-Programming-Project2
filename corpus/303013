Dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere as seen by MF radars and by the high-resolution Doppler imager/UARS
 Abstract.  This paper presents comparisons between wind measurements in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by medium-frequency (MF) radars and by the high-resolution Doppler imager onboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  Because of distinctive observational patterns, time and space averaging, and data processing algorithms, satellites and radars observe the atmosphere from their own perspectives.  Because thermal tides are an important part of dynamics in these regions of the atmosphere, tidal determinations from both techniques were given particular attention.  Differences and similarities of the two methods are discussed and analyzed.
