Chapter 6
 Abstract This chapter covers three principle morphometric methods, that will be called voxelbased, deformation-based and tensor-based morphometry.  Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) is a method for identifying macroscopic anatomical differences among the brains of different populations of subjects.  The method involves spatially normalizing the structural MR images of a number of subjects so that they all conform to the same stereotaxic space.  Multivariate statistics are then applied to the parameters describing the estimated nonlinear deformations that ensue.  Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is introduced as a method of identifying regional structural differences from the gradients of deformations fields.  Deformation 1 fields encode the relative positions of different brain structures, but local shapes (such as volumes, lengths and areas) are encoded in their gradients (Jacobian matrix field).  Various functions of these tensor-fields can be used to characterize shape differences.  At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of grey matter between two groups of subjects.  The procedure is relatively straight-forward, and involves spatially normalizing highresolution MR images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotaxic space.  This is followed by segmenting the grey matter from the spatially normalized images, and smoothing these grey-matter segments.  Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests are performed which compare the smoothed grey-matter images from the groups.  Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields.
