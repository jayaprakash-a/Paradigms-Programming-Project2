Support Vector Machines for Dyadic Data
 Abstract We describe a new technique for the analysis of dyadic data, where two sets of objects ("row" and "column" objects) are characterized by a matrix of numerical values which describe their mutual relationships.  The new technique, called "Potential Support Vector Machine" (P-
