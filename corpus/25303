Efficient Value of Information for Graphical Models --DRAFT-
 Abstract Value of information (VOI) calculations are vital to many operations on in graphical models, e. g. , active learning and sensitivity analysis.  Previously, all-pairs VOI calculation has involved a cost quadratic in network size.  In this work, we show how to perform the same computation with cost linear in network size.  The loss function that allows this is of a form amenable to computation by dynamic programming.  The messagepassing algorithm that results is described and empirical results demonstrate large speedups without decrease in accuracy.  In the cost-sensitive domains examined, superior accuracy is achieved.
