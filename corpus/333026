Monotone method for nonlinear nonlocal hyperbolic problems
 Abstract We present recent results concerning the application of the monotone method for studying existence and uniqueness of solutions to general firstorder nonlinear nonlocal hyperbolic problems.  The limitations of comparison principles for such nonlocal problems are discussed.  To overcome these limitations, we introduce new definitions for upper and lower solutions.
