COLOR CONVERSIONS USING MAXIMUM ENTROPY ESTIMATION
 ABSTRACT We propose a new estimation method using the maximum entropy principle and show that it is successfully used for the three-dimensional interpolation step involved in many color conversions.  Color conversions are a key part of color management systems, and many device characterizations, especially for printers, rely on multidimensional interpolation to perform the conversion.  Our method is a linear interpolation that is not limited in the number of sample points used to estimate new color values.  We find a unique solution to the underdetermined inverse matrix problem by invoking the maximum entropy principle.  We compare our approach to the standard technique of tetrahedral interpolation and demonstrate that more accurate and more robust approximations may result.
