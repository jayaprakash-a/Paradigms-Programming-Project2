Programmable Reinforcement Learning Agents
 Abstract We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learning that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learning process. The language includes standard features such as parameterized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but also allows for unspecified choices in the agent program.  For learning that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algorithms.  We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the language are concise as well as modular.  This facilitates state abstraction and the transferability of learned skills.
