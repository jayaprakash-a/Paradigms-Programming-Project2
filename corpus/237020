Learning Shared Latent Structure for Image Synthesis and Robotic Imitation
 Abstract We propose an algorithm that uses Gaussian process regression to learn common hidden structure shared between corresponding sets of heterogenous observations.  The observation spaces are linked via a single, reduced-dimensionality latent variable space.  We present results from two datasets demonstrating the algorithms's ability to synthesize novel data from learned correspondences.  We first show that the method can be used to learn the nonlinear mapping between corresponding views of objects, filling in missing data as needed to synthesize novel views.  We then show that the method can be used to acquire a mapping between human degrees of freedom and robotic degrees of freedom for a humanoid robot, allowing robotic imitation of human poses from motion capture data.
