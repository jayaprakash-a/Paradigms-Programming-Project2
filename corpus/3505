Using Pairs of Data-Points to Define Splits for Decision Trees
 Abstract Conventional binary classification trees such as CART either split the data using axis-aligned hyperplanes or they perform a computationally expensive search in the continuous space of completely unrestricted hyperplanes.  We show that the limitations of the former can be overcome without resorting to the latter.  For every pair of training data-points, there is one hyperplane that is orthogonal to the line joining the data-points and bisects this line.  In a comparison on a suite of 12 datasets we found that this method of generating candidate splits outperformed axis-aligned splits, particularly when the training sets are data limited.
