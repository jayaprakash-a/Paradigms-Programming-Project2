Hierarchical Non-linear Factor Analysis and Topographic Maps
 Abstract We first describe a hierarchical, generative model that can be viewed as a non-linear generalization of factor analysis and can be implemented in a neural network.  The model performs perceptual inference in a probabilistically consistent manner by using top-down, bottom-up and lateral connections.  These connections can be learned using simple rules that require only locally available information.  We then show how to incorporate non-adaptive lateral connections into the generative model.  The model extracts a sparse, distributed, hierarchical representation of depth from simplified random-dot stereograms and the localized disparity detectors in the first hidden layer form a topographic map.
