3D Object Modeling and Recognition Using Affine-Invariant Patches and Multi-View Spatial Constraints
 Abstract: This paper presents a novel representation for three-dimensional objects in terms of affine-invariant image patches and their spatial relationships.  Multi-view constraints associated with groups of patches are combined with a normalized representation of their appearance to guide matching and reconstruction, allowing the acquisition of true three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models from multiple images and their recognition in a single photograph taken from an arbitrary viewpoint.  The proposed approach does not require a separate segmentation stage and is applicable to cluttered scenes.  Preliminary modeling and recognition results are presented.
