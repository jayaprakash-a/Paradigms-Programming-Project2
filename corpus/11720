A Hierarchical Probabilistic Model for Novelty Detection in Text
 Abstract Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a variant of classification in which the set of classes grows over time.  This paper describes a new approach to TDT based on probabilistic, generative models.  Strong statistical techniques address the many challenges: hierarchical shrinkage for sparse data, statistical \garbage collection" for new event detection, clustering in time to separate the different events of a common topic, and deterministic annealing to create the hierarchy.  Preliminary experimental results show promise.
