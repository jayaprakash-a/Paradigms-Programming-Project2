Kernel Query By Committee (KQBC)
 Abstract The Query By Committee (QBC) algorithm is the only algorithm in the active learning framework that has a full theoretical justification.  It was proved that it can reduce exponentially the number of labels needed for learning.  Unfortunately, a naive implementation of this algorithm is impossible due to impractical time complexity.  In this paper we make another step toward a practical implementation.  The running time of our novel method does not depend on the input dimension but only on the number of labels obtained already.  Moreover, it can be expressed in term of inner products only, and therefore we get a kernel version of the QBC algorithm.
