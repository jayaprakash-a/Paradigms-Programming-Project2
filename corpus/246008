Distribution Free Decomposition of Multivariate Data
 Abstract We present a practical approach to nonparametric cluster analysis of large data sets.  The number of clusters and the cluster centers are automatically derivedbymode seeking with the mean shift procedure on a reduced set of points randomly selected from the data.  The cluster boundaries are delineated using a k-nearest neighbor technique.  The proposed algorithm is stable and efficient, a 10000 point data set being decomposed in only a few seconds.  Complex clustering examples and applications are discussed, and convergence of the gradient ascent mean shift procedure is demonstrated for arbitrary distribution and cardinality of the data.
