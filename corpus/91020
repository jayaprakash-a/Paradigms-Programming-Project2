Splitting and Merging Components of a Nonconjugate Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
 Abstract.  The inferential problem of associating data to mixture components is dicult when components are nearby or overlapping.  We introduce a new split-merge Markov chain Monte Carlo technique that eciently classifies observations by splitting and merging mixture components of a nonconjugate Dirichlet process mixture model.  Our method, which is a Metropolis-Hastings procedure with split-merge proposals, samples clusters of observations simultaneously rather than incrementally assigning observations to mixture components.  Split-merge moves are produced by exploiting properties of a restricted Gibbs sampling scan.  A simulation study compares the new split-merge technique to a nonconjugate version of Gibbs sampling and an incremental MetropolisHastings technique.  The results demonstrate the improved performance of the new sampler.  We illustrate the utility of our technique as an unsupervised clustering method using real data.
