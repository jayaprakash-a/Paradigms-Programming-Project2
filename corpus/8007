Reducing Multiclass to Binary: A Unifying Approach for Margin Classifiers
 Abstract We present a unifying framework for studying the solution of multiclass categorization problems by reducing them to multiple binary problems that are then solved using a margin-based binary learning algorithm.  The proposed
