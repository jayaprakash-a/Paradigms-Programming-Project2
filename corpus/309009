Representing hierarchical POMDPs as DBNs for multi-scale robot localization
 Abstract--- We explore the advantages of representing hierarchical partially observable Markov decision processes (HPOMDPs) as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs).  In particular, we focus on the special case of using H-POMDPs to represent multi-resolution spatial maps for indoor robot navigation.  Our results show that a DBN representation of H-POMDPs can train significantly faster than the original learning algorithm for HPOMDPs or the equivalent flat POMDP, and requires much less data.  In addition, the DBN formulation can easily be extended to parameter tying and factoring of variables, which further reduces the time and sample complexity.  This enables us to apply H-POMDP methods to much larger problems than previously possible.
