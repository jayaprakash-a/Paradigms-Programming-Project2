Black--Scholes formula without stochastic assumptions
 Abstract The usual stochastic assumptions of the Black--Scholes formula are replaced by assumptions about fractal dimensions describing the price paths of the underlying security and the square (the European option which pays the squared price of the underlying at the expiry).  In particular, it is sufficient to require that the price path of the underlying security should have a fractal dimension of at most 1 1 2 (which is the fractal dimension of typical stochastic processes, such as the price path of the underlying in the Black--Scholes model) and that the "remaining volatility path" implied by the square should have a fractal dimension of less than 1 1 2 (ie, it should be "substochastic").  For simplicity we assume zero interest rate.
