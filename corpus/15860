Learning Rates for Q-learning
 Abstract In this paper we derive convergence rates for Q-learning.  We show an interesting relationship between the convergence rate and the learning rate used in the Q-learning.  For a polynomial learning rate, one which is 1/t ! at time t where ! 2 (1/2, 1), we show that the convergence rate is polynomial in 1/(1 - ), where is the discount factor.  In contrast we show that for a linear learning rate, one which is 1/t at time t, the convergence rate has an exponential dependence on 1/(1 - ).  In addition we show a simple example that proves that this exponential behavior is inherent for a linear learning rate.
