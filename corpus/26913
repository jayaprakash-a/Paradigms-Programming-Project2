Scientific Data Mining, Integration, and Visualization
 This report summarises the workshop on Scientific Data Mining, Integration and Visualization (SDMIV) held at the e-Science Institute, Edinburgh (eSI[1] ) on 24-25 October 2002, and presents a set of recommendations arising from the discussion that took place there.  The aims of the workshop were three-fold: (A) To inform researchers in the SDMIV communities of the infrastructural advances being made by computing initiatives, such as the Grid; (B) To feed back requirements from the SDMIV areas to those developing the computational infrastructure; and (C) To foster interaction among all these communities, since the coordinated efforts of all of them will be required to realise the potential for scientific knowledge extraction offered by e-science initiatives worldwide.  The workshop had about fifty participants, ranging from software engineers developing Grid infrastructure software, to computer scientists with expertise in data mining and visualization, to application specialists from a wide range of disciplines,
