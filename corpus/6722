A Probability Analysis on the Value of Unlabeled Data for Classification Problems
 Abstract Recently, there has been increasing interest in using unlabeled data for classification.  In order to understand better the value of using unlabeled data under certain learning models, it is worthwhile to formulate the problem precisely, and to analyze relevant issues carefully.  In this paper, we approach this problem from the statistical point of view, where we know a correct model of the underlying distribution.  Fisher information matrices are used to judge the asymptotic value of unlabeled data.  We apply this methodology to both "passive partially supervised learning" and "active learning", and draw conclusions.  Experiments will also be provided.
