Reducing Drift in Parametric Motion Tracking
 Abstract We develop a class of differential motion trackers that automatically stabilize when in finite domains.  Most differential trackers compute motion only relative to one previous frame, accumulating errors indefinitely.  We estimate pose changes between a set of past frames, and develop a probabilistic framework for integrating those estimates.  We use an approximation to the posterior distribution of pose changes as an uncertainty model for parametric motion in order to help arbitrate the use of multiple base frames.  We demonstrate this framework on a simple 2D translational tracker and a 3D, 6-degree of freedom tracker.
