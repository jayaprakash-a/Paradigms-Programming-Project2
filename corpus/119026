Models of Bottom-Up Attention and Saliency
 Abstract: Visually conspicuous, or so-called salient, stimuli often have the capability of attracting focal visual attention towards their locations.  Several computational architectures subserving this bottom-up, stimulus-driven, spatiotemporal deployment of attention are reviewed in this article.  The resulting computational models have applications not only to the prediction of visual search psychophysics, but also, in the domain of machine vision, to the rapid selection of regions of interest in complex, cluttered visual environments.  We describe an unusal such application, to the objective evaluation of advertising designs.  One of the most important functions of selective visual attention is to rapidly direct our gaze towards objects of interest in our visual environment.  From an evolutionary standpoint, this rapid orienting capability is critical in allowing living systems to quickly become aware of possible preys, mates or predators in their cluttered visual world.  It has become clear that attention guides where to look next based on both bottom-up (image-based) and top-down (task-dependent) cues (James, 1890/1981).  As such, attention implements an information processing bottleneck, only allowing a small part of the incoming sensory information to reach short-
