A Support Vector Machine Approach to Decision Trees
 Abstract Key ideas from statistical learning theory and support vector machines are generalized to decision trees.  A support vector machine is used for each decision in the tree.  The "optimal" decision tree is characterized, and both a primal and dual space formulation for constructing the tree are proposed.  The result is a method for generating logically simple decision trees with multivariate linear or nonlinear decisions.  The preliminary results indicate that the method produces simple trees that generalize well with respect to other decision tree algorithms and single support vector machines.
