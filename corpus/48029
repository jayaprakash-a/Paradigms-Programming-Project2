NONNEGATIVE DECONVOLUTION FOR TIME OF ARRIVAL ESTIMATION
 ABSTRACT The interaural time difference (ITD) of arrival is a primary cue for acoustic sound source localization.  Traditional estimation techniques for ITD based upon cross-correlation are related to maximum-likelihood estimation of a simple generative model.  We generalize the time difference estimation into a deconvolution problem with nonnegativity constraints.  The resulting nonnegative least squares optimization can be efficiently solved using a novel iterative algorithm with guaranteed global convergence properties.  We illustrate the utility of this algorithm using simulations and experimental results from a robot platform.
