A Hybrid ANN/DBN Approach to Articulatory Feature Recognition
 Abstract Artificial neural networks (ANN) have proven to be well suited to the task of articulatory feature (AF) recognition.  Previous studies have taken a cascaded approach where separate ANNs are trained for each feature group, making the assumption that features are statistically independent.  We address this by using ANNs to provide virtual evidence to a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN).  This gives a hybrid ANN/DBN model and allows modelling of inter-feature dependencies.  We demonstrate significant increases in AF recognition accuracy from modelling dependencies between features, and present the results of embedded training experiments in which a set of asynchronous feature changes are learned.  Furthermore, we report on the application of a Viterbi training scheme in which we alternate between realigning the AF training labels and retraining the ANNs.
