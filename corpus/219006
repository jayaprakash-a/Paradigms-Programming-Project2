Large Recoil Momenta in the D(e,e'p)n Reaction
 Abstract The D(e,e 0 p)n reaction cross section has been measured for recoil momenta ranging from 17 MeV/c up to 950 MeV/c at momentum transfers between 600 MeV/c and 700 MeV/c.  At recoil momenta above 400 MeV/c, the gross features of the cross section are only reproduced if virtual nucleon excitations are included in the calculations.
