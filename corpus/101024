Object Class Recognition by Unsupervised Scale-Invariant Learning
 Abstract We present a method to learn and recognize object class models from unlabeled and unsegmented cluttered scenes in a scale invariant manner.  Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts.  A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale.  An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image.  In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated.  This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting.  In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images.  The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e. g.  faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals).
