ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF INTERNAL PIPELINE IMAGES

The vast amounts of data generated prohibits human inspection of the resulting images.  We designed an image processing and classification method to identify abnormal events.  Non-overlapping image blocks are classified into twelve categories:
