An optimization-based categorization of reinforcement learning environments
 Abstract 1 This paper proposes a categorization of reinforcement learning environments based on the optimization of a reinforcement signal over time.  Environments are classified by the simplest agent that can possibly achieve optimal reinforcement.  Two parameters, h and fi, abstractly characterize the complexity of an agent: the ideal (h,fi)-agent uses the input information provided by the environment and at most h bits of local storage to choose an action that maximizes the discounted sum of the next fi reinforcements.  In an (h,fi)-environment, an ideal (h,fi)-agent achieves the maximum possible expected reinforcement for that environment.  The paper discusses the special cases when either h = 0 or fi = 1 in detail, describes some theoretical bounds on h and fi and reexplores a well-known reinforcement learning environment with this new notation.
