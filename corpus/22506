Dissociating functor-argument structure from surface phrase structure: the relationship of HPSG Order Domains to LFG
 Abstract Recent work on order domains and linearization in HPSG, and also conceptually related work in categorial grammar, is argued to mirror the key ideas that motivated the separation between c-structure and f-structure in the earliest work in LFG (Bresnan 1982).  This paper argues that: (i) to be descriptively adequate, all constraint-based frameworks do indeed need a dissociation between functor-argument structure and surface phrase structure, (ii) while linearization HPSG can technically be regarded as a one-level/one-stratum architecture, the complex attribute-value matrix representations proposed are better thought of as encoding multiple `virtual levels', and (iii) once this is noted, there is a general equivalence between the analyses that can be proposed in linearization HPSG and LFG, although certain differences are noted.
