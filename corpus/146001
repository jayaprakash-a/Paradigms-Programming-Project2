Dynamical Synapses Give Rise to a Power-Law Distribution of Neuronal Avalanches
 Abstract There is experimental evidence that cortical neurons show avalanche activity with the intense of firing events being distributed as a power-law.  We present a biologically plausible extension of a neural network which exhibits a power-law avalanche distribution for a wide range of connectivity parameters.
