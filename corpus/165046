ROBUST CONFIDENCE ANNOTATION AND REJECTION FOR CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION
 ABSTRACT We are looking for confidence scoring techniques that perform well on a broad variety of tasks.  Our main focus is on word-level error rejection, but most results apply to other scenarios as well.  A variation of the Normalized Cross Entropy that is adapted to that purpose is introduced.  It is successfully used to automatically select features and optimize the word-level confidence measure on several test sets.  Sentence-level confidence geared toward the rejection of out-of-grammar utterances is also investigated.  The combination of a word graph based technique and the acoustic score shows excellent performance across all the tasks we considered.
