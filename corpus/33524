Epipolar Geometry and Linear Subspace Methods: A New Approach to Weak Calibration
 Abstract This paper addresses the problem of estimating the epipolar geometry from point correspondences between two images taken by uncalibrated perspective cameras.  It is shown that Jepson's and Heeger's linear subspace technique for infinitesimal motion estimation can be generalized to the finite motion case by choosing an appropriate basis for projective space.  This yields a linear method for weak calibration.  The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested on both real and synthetic images, and it is compared to other linear and non-linear approaches to weak calibration.
