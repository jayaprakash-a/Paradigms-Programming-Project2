The Multimodal Signature Method : An Eciency Study
 Abstract The multimodal neighbourhood signature (MNS) method has presented acceptable results both for the colour-based image retrieval and the object recognition task.  Local colour content is concisely represented by invariant features computed from neighbourhoods with multimodal colour density function.  In this paper, eciency related issues regarding the MNS algorithm are investigated.  Its performance, speed, sensitivity and storage requirements are tested on a standard colour object recognition experiment.  Very good recognition rate (99. 9%) was achieved in real time (0. 28 seconds per match).  MNS signatures are concise and thus significant data reduction is achieved.  The complexity of signature computation and matching are analysed and ecient implementations are proposed.
