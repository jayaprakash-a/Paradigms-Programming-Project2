 13 Sparse Representation for Gaussian Process Models.  Abstract We develop an approach for a sparse representation for Gaussian Process (GP) models in order to overcome the limitations of GPs caused by large data sets.  The method is based on a combination of a Bayesian online algorithm together with a sequential construction of a relevant subsample of the data which fully specifies the prediction of the model.  Experimental results on toy examples and large real-world datasets indicate the efficiency of the approach.
