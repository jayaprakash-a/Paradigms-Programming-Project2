Improved Competitive Guarantees for QoS Buffering
 Abstract We consider a network providing Differentiated Services (Diffserv) which allow Internet service providers (ISP) to offer different levels of Quality of Service (QoS) to different traffic streams.  We study two types of buffering policies that are used in network switches supporting QoS.  In the FIFO type, packets must be transmitted in the order they arrive.  In the bounded-delay type, each packet has a maximum delay time by which it must be transmitted, or otherwise it is lost.  In both models, the buffer space is limited, and packets are lost if the buffer is full.  Each packet has an intrinsic value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of transmitted packets.  Our main contribution is an algorithm for the FIFO model for arbitrary packet values that for the first time achieves a competitive ratio better than 2, namely 2- # for a constant # } 0.  We also describe an algorithm for the bounded delay model that simulates our algorithm for the FIFO model, and show that it achieves the same competitive ratio.
