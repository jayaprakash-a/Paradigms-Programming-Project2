Competitive Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation
 Abstract We propose a realistic theoretical model for dynamic bandwidth allocation.  Our model takes into account the two classical quality of service parameters: latency and utilization, together with a newly introduced parameter: number of bandwidth allocation changes, which are costly operations in today's networks.  Our model assumes that sessions join the network with a certain delay requirement rather than a bandwidth requirement as assumed in previous models.  In addition, the network has a certain utilization requirement.  Given bounds on latency and utilization, we design online algorithms that minimize the number of bandwidth allocation changes.
