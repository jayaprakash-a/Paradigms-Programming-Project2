Evaluating Look-to-Talk: A Gaze-Aware Interface in a Collaborative Environment
 ABSTRACT We present "look-to-talk", a gaze-aware interface for directing a spoken utterance to a software agent in a multiuser collaborative environment.  Through a prototype and a Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) experiment, we show that "look-totalk" is indeed a natural alternative to speech and other paradigms.
