Epipolar Geometry Estimation via RANSAC Benefits from the Oriented Epipolar Constraint
 Abstract The efficiency of epipolar geometry estimation by RANSAC is improved by exploiting the oriented epipolar constraint.  Performance evaluation shows that the enhancement brings up to a two-fold speed-up.  The orientation test is simple to implement, is universally applicable and takes negligible fraction of time compared with epipolar geometry computation.
