Mixture Models for Image Representation
 Abstract We consider the estimation of local grey-level image structure in terms of a layered representation.  This type of representation has recently been successfully used to segment foreground objects from various backgrounds using either optical flow or stereo disparity information.  We argue that the same type of representation is useful for greylevel data in that it allows for the automatic assignment of each pixel to one of several local layers or to an outlier distribution.  The combined description of the local layers, along with the corresponding pixel assignments, provides a compact representation of the original image.  Our emphasis in this paper is on the process used to extract such a layered representation from a given image.  In particular, we consider a variant of the EM-algorithm for the estimation of the layer parameters and pixel assignments, and consider a novel technique for choosing the number of layers to use.  We also briefly consider the use of such a representation for image segmentation.
