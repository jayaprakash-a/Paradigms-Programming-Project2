WS96 Project Report DEPENDENCY LANGUAGE MODELING
 Abstract This report summarizes the work of the Dependency Language Modeling group at the 1996 Summer Speech Workshop at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University (WS96).  We motivate and describe a novel statistical language model based on the syntactic dependencies between words.  The model is formulated in the maximum entropy framework, which expresses statistical constraints on the frequencies of various type of dependencies, as well the standard N-gram statistics.  We describe how this model was applied to the recognition of spontaneous English speech from the Switchboard corpus.  Because of implementation constraints, only a reduced version of our model could be tested.  The model gave a modest improvement over an N-gram baseline model.  A byproduct of the project is the Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit (MEMT), a freely available software package for domain-independent maximum entropy modeling.
