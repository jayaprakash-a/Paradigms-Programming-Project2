 Abstract In this paper, we propose a stochastic version of a general purpose functional programming language as a method of modeling stochastic processes.  The language contains random choices, conditional statements, structured values, defined functions, and recursion.  By imagining an experiment in which the program is "run" and the random choices made by sampling, we can interpret a program in this language as encoding a probability distribution over a (potentially infinite) set of objects.  We provide an exact algorithm for computing conditional probabilities of the form Pr(P (x)
