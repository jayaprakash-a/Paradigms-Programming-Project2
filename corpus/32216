Content-based audio classification and segmentation by using support vector machines
 Abstract.  Content-based audio classification and segmentation is a basis for further audio/video analysis.  In this paper, we present our work on audio segmentation and classification which employs support vector machines (SVMs).  Five audio classes are considered in this paper: silence, music, background sound, pure speech, and non-pure speech which includes speech over music and speech over noise.  A sound stream is segmented by classifying each sub-segment into one of these five classes.  We have evaluated the performance of SVM on different audio type-pairs classification with testing unit of different-length and compared the performance of SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).  We also evaluated the effectiveness of some new proposed features.  Experiments on a database composed of about 4-hour audio data show that the proposed classifier is very efficient on audio classification and segmentation.  It also shows the accuracy of the SVM-based method is much better than the method based on KNN and GMM.
