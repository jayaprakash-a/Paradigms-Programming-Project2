AN IMPROVED MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING DISFLUENCIES IN CONVERSATIONAL SPEECH
 ABSTRACT This paper presents a novel metadata extraction (MDE) system for automatically detecting edited words, fillers, and self-interruption points in conversational speech.  Our edit word detection sub-system combines a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) noisy channel model, a statistical syntactic language model, and a MaxEnt reranker.  Hand-built, deterministic rules are used to detect fillers.  Self-interruption points are explicitly determined by detected fillers and edited words.  We have evaluated our system for these three tasks on two types of input: manually annotated words and automatically recognized speech-to-text tokens.  In all six cases, our system has improved the state-of-the-art, as measured in a recent blind evaluation.
