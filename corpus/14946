A Tutorial on -Support Vector Machines
 Abstract.  We briefly describe the main ideas of statistical learning theory, support vector machines (SVMs), and kernel feature spaces.  We place particular emphasis on a description of the so-called -SVM, including details of the algorithm and its implementation, theoretical results, and practical applications.  1 An Introductory Example Suppose we are given empirical data (x 1 , y 1 ), .  .  .  , (x m , y m ) 2 X {1}.  (1) Here, the domain X is some nonempty set that the patterns x i are taken from; the y i are called labels or targets.  Unless stated otherwise, indices i and j will always be understood to run over the training set, i. e. , i,
