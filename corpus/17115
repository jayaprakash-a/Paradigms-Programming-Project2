Sequential Activity Profiling : Latent Dirichlet Allocation of Markov Chains
 Abstract To provide a parsimonious generative representation of the sequential activity of a number of individuals within a population there is a necessary tradeoff between the definition of individual specific and global representations.  A linear-time algorithm is proposed that defines a distributed predictive model for finite state symbolic sequences which represent the traces of the activity of a number of individuals within a group.  The algorithm is based on a straightforward generalization of latent Dirichlet allocation to time-invariant Markov chains of arbitrary order.  The modelling assumption made is that the possibly heterogeneous behavior of individuals may be represented by a relatively small number of simple and common behavioral traits which may interleave randomly according to an individual-specific distribution.  The results of an empirical study on three different application domains indicate that this modelling approach provides an efficient low-complexity and intuitively interpretable representation scheme which is reflected by improved prediction performance over comparable models.
