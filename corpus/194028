The Challenge of Image and Video Retrieval (
 Abstract.  A novel approach to content-based image retrieval is presented.  The method supports recognition of objects under a very wide range of viewing and illumination conditions and is robust to occlusion and background clutter.  Starting from robustly detected 'distinguished regions' of data dependent shape, local affine frames are established by affine-invariant constructions exploiting invariant properties of the second moment matrix and bi-tangent points.  Direct comparison of photometrically normalised colour intensities in normalised frames facilitates robust, affine and illumination invariant, but still very selective matching.  The potential of the proposed approach is experimentally verified on FOCUS --a publicly available image database --- using a standard set of query images.  The results obtained are superior to the state of the art.  The method operates successfully on images with complex background, where the sought object covers only a fraction (around 2%) of the database image.  Examples of precise localisation of the query objects in an image are shown too.
