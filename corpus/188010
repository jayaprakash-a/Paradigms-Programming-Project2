Supporting Early Intervention Programmes for specialneeds children with personal digital assistants
 Abstract We describe flexible logging software designed for use in behavioural therapy programmes for special needs children.  This software runs on a handheld computer or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and is flexible and easy to use, so that parents or teachers can customise the logger to the needs of individual children and programmes.  The software is intended to allow parents or teachers to record high quality behavioural data with minimal intrusion into the teaching and interaction with children.  We also give an example of how PDAs can be used directly as a teaching tool, with a program which allows parents to design a speech/picture association game for their own child.
