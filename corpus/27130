Text Classification by Bootstrapping with Keywords, EM and Shrinkage
 Abstract When applying text classification to complex tasks, it is tedious and expensive to hand-label the large amounts of training data necessary for good performance.  This paper presents an alternative approach to text classification that requires no labeled documents; instead, it uses a small set of keywords per class, a class hierarchy and a large quantity of easilyobtained unlabeled documents.  The keywords are used to assign approximate labels to the unlabeled documents by termmatching.  These preliminary labels become the starting point for a bootstrapping process that learns a naive Bayes classi#er using Expectation-Maximization and hierarchical shrinkage.  When classifying a complex data set of computer science research papers into a 70-leaf topic hierarchy, the keywords alone provide 45% accuracy.  The classifier learned by bootstrapping reaches 66% accuracy, a level close to human agreement.
