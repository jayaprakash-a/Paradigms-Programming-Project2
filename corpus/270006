CREME: Cis-Regulatory Module Explorer for the human genome
 ABSTRACT The binding of transcription factors to specific regulatory sequence elements is a primary mechanism for controlling gene transcription.  Eukaryotic genes are often regulated by several transcription factors whose binding sites are tightly clustered and form cis-regulatory modules.  In this paper, we present a web server, CREME, for identifying and visualizing cis-regulatory modules in the promoter regions of a given set of potentially co-regulated genes.  CREME relies on a database of putative transcription factor binding sites that have been annotated across the human genome using a library of position weight matrices and evolutionary conservation with the mouseand rat genomes. Asearch algorithm is applied to this data set to identify combinations of transcription factors whose binding sites tend to co-occur in close proximity in the promoter regions of the input gene set.  The identified cis-regulatory modules are statistically scored and significant combinations are reported and graphically visualized.  Our web server is available at http://creme. dcode. org.
