Spectral Clustering for Microsoft Netscan Data
 Abstract We present the results of exploratory data analysis for a data set that consists of crossposting information for 89,687 newsgroups over a period of 3. 4 years.  The data set we use is a part of Microsoft Netscan data.  Our goal is to investigate the community structure of the newsgroup data set with a specific focus on spectral hierarchical clustering.  We present a spectral hierarchical clustering algorithm and discuss existing and novel ways to measure the quality of a hierarchical clustering.  We construct spectral hierarchical clusterings for ten subsets of the data set and evaluate the stability of the results.
