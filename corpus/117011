Histogram Clustering for Unsupervised Image Segmentation
 Abstract This paper introduces a novel statistical mixture model for probabilistic grouping of distributional (histogram) data.  Adopting the Bayesian framework, we propose to perform annealed maximum a posteriori estimation to compute optimal clustering solutions.  In order to accelerate the optimization process, an efficient multiscale formulation is developed.  We present a prototypical application of this method for the unsupervised segmentation of textured images based on local distributions of Gabor coefficients.  Benchmark results indicate superior performance compared to K--means clustering and proximity-based algorithms.
