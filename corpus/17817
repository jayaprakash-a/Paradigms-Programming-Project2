A Low-Power CMOS Analog Vector Quantizer
 Abstract---We present a parallel analog vector quantizer (VQ) in 2. 0-m double-poly CMOS technology and analyze its energetic efficiency.  The prototype chip contains an array of 16 2 16 charge-based distance estimation cells, implementing a 16 analog input, 4-b coded output VQ with a mean absolute difference (MAD) distance metric.  The distance cell including dynamic template storage measures 60 2 78 m 2 .  The output code is produced by a 16-cell winner-take-all (WTA) output circuit of linear complexity which selects the winning template with constant power-delay product, independent of input levels and scale.  Experimental results demonstrate 34 dB analog input dynamic range and 0. 7 mW power dissipation at 3 s cycle.
