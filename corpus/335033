Affine-Invariant Local Descriptors and Neighborhood Statistics for Texture Recognition
 Abstract This paper presents a framework for texture recognition based on local affine-invariant descriptors and their spatial layout.  At modeling time, a generative model of local descriptors is learned from sample images using the EM algorithm.  The EM framework allows the incorporation of unsegmented multi-texture images into the training set.  The second modeling step consists of gathering co-occurrence statistics of neighboring descriptors.  At recognition time, initial probabilities computed from the generative model are refined using a relaxation step that incorporates cooccurrence statistics.  Performance is evaluated on images of an indoor scene and pictures of wild animals.
