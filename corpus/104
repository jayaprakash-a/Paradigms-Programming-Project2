AUTOMATIC LINE MATCHING AND 3D RECONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS FROM MULTIPLE VIEWS
 ABSTRACT This paper describes two developments in the automatic reconstruction of buildings from aerial images.  The first is an algorithm for automatically matching line segments over multiple images.  The algorithm employs geometric constraints based on the multi-view geometry together with photometric constraints derived from the line neighbourhood, and achieves a performance of better than 95% correct matches over three views.  The second development is a method for automatically computing a piecewise planar reconstruction based on the matched lines.  The novelty here is that a planar facet hypothesis can be generated from a single 3D line, using an inter-image homography applied to the line neighbourhood.  The algorithm has successfully generated near complete roof reconstructions from multiple images.  This work has been carried out as part of the EC IMPACT project.  A summary of the project is included.
