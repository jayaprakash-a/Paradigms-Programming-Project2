AN EVENT--BASED VLSI NETWORK OF INTEGRATE--AND--FIRE NEURONS
 ABSTRACT The growing interest in pulse--based neural networks is encouraging the development of hardware implementations of massively parallel, distributed networks of Integrate--and-Fire (I&F) neurons.  We have developed a mixed--mode (analog/digital) VLSI device that comprises a reconfigurable network of I&F neurons and adaptive synapses.  The synapses receive input spikes and the neurons transmit output spikes (events) using an asynchronous Address--Event Representation (AER).  In this paper we describe the network architecture, present experimental data demonstrating the characteristics of the single elements on the chip, and show that a competitive network configuration has Winner--Take--All (WTA) behavior and produces spike synchronization.
