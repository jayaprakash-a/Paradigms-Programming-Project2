Variability in Wrist-Tilt Accelerometer Based Gesture Interfaces
 Abstract.  In this paper we describe a study that examines human performance in a tilt control targeting task on a PDA.  A three-degree of freedom accelerometer attached to the base of the PDA allows users to navigate to the targets by tilting their wrist in different directions.  Post hoc analysis of performance data has been used to classify the ease of targeting and variability of movement in the different directions.  The results show that there is an increase in
