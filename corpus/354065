Randomized Approximation Schemes for Cuts and Flows in Capacitated Graphs
 Abstract We improve on random sampling techniques for approximately solving problems that involve cuts and flows in graphs.  We give a near-linear-time construction that transforms any graph on n vertices into an O(n log n)-edge graph on the same vertices whose cuts have approximately the same value as the original graph's.  In this new graph, for example, we can run the ~ O(m 3=2 )-time maximum flow algorithm of Goldberg and Rao to find an s--t minimum cut in ~ O(n 3=2 ) time.  This corresponds to a (1 + #)-times minimum s--t cut in the original graph.  In a similar way, we can approximate a sparsest cut to within O(log n) in ~ O(n 2 ) time using a previous ~ O(mn)-time algorithm.  A related approach leads to a randomized divide and conquer algorithm producing an approximately maximum flow in ~ O(m p n) time.
