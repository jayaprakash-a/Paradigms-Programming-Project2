Building Roadmaps of Minima and Transitions in Visual Models
 Abstract Becoming trapped in suboptimal local minima is a perennial problem when optimizing visual models, particularly in applications like monocular human body tracking where complicated parametric models are repeatedly fitted to ambiguous image measurements.  We show that trapping can be significantly reduced by building `roadmaps' of nearby minima linked by transition pathways --- paths leading over low `mountain passes' in the cost surface --- found by locating the transition state (codimension-1 saddle point) at the top of the pass and then sliding downhill to the next minimum.  We present two families of transition-state-finding algorithms based on local optimization.  In eigenvector tracking, unconstrained Newton minimization is modified to climb uphill towards a transition state, while in hypersurface sweeping, a moving hypersurface is swept through the space and moving local minima within it are tracked using a constrained Newton method.  These widely applicable numerical methods, which appear not to be known in vision and optimization, generalize methods from computational chemistry where finding transition states is critical for predicting reaction parameters.  Experiments on the challenging problem of estimating 3D human pose from monocular images show that our algorithms find nearby transition states and minima very efficiently, but also underline the disturbingly large numbers of minima that can exist in this and similar model based vision problems.
