Perceptual distortion contributes to the curvature of human reaching movements
 Abstract Unconstrained point-to-point human arm movements are generally gently curved, a fact which has been used to assess the validity of models of trajectory formation.  In this study we examined the relationship between curvature perception and movement curvature for planar sagittal and transverse arm movements.  We found a significant correlation (p ! 0:0001, n = 16) between the curvature perceived as straight and the curvature of actual arm movements.  We suggest that subjects try to make straight-line movements, but that actual movements are curved because visual perceptual distortion makes the movements appear to be straighter than they really are.  We conclude that perceptual distortion of curvature contributes to the curvature seen in human point-to-point arm movements and that this must be taken into account in the assessment of models of trajectory formation.
