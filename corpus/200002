All We Believe Fails in Impossible Worlds A possible-world semantics for a "knowing at most" operator
 Abstract We extend the familiar possible-world semantics of modal logic by considering the 'impossible' worlds of a Kripke structure.  We obtain a simple semantics for Levesque's ''All I know" logic.  We provide a natural proof theory and prove the expected soundness and completeness theorems.  From a mathematical point of view we offer a natural generalization of modal logic that significantly strengthens its expressive power.  Considered in the context of Knowledge Representation, such a logic is a standard monotonic logic that allows formal treatment of default reasoning.  \Lambda e-mail 'shai@techsel. bitnet', phone (972-4)294266.
