A Survey of Convergence Results on Particle Filtering Methods for Practitioners
 Abstract---Optimal filtering problems are ubiquitous in signal processing and related fields.  Except for a restricted class of models, the optimal filter does not admit a closed-form expression.  Particle filtering methods are a set of flexible and powerful sequential Monte Carlo methods designed to solve the optimal filtering problem numerically.  The posterior distribution of the state is approximated by a large set of Dirac-delta masses (samples/particles) that evolve randomly in time according to the dynamics of the model and the observations.  The particles are interacting; thus, classical limit theorems relying on statistically independent samples do not apply.  In this paper, our aim is to present a survey of recent convergence results on this class of methods to make them accessible to practitioners.
