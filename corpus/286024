A biologically inspired computational model of the Block Copying Task
 Abstract We present in this paper a biologically inspired model of the Basal Ganglia which deals with Block Copying as a sequence learning task.  By breaking a relatively complex task into simpler operations with well-defined skills, an approach which is termed as a skill-based machine design is used in the device of computational models to complete such tasks.  Basal Ganglia are critically involved in sensorimotor control.  From the learning aspects, Actor-Critic architectures have been proposed to model the Basal Ganglia and Temporal Difference has been proposed as a learning algorithm.  The model is implemented and simulation results are presented to shows the capability of our model to successfully complete the task.
