Visual Identification by Signature Tracking
 Abstract We propose a new camera-based biometric: visual signature identification.  We discuss the importance of the parameterization of the signatures in order to achieve good classification results, independently of variations in the position of the camera with respect to the writing surface.  We show that ane arc-length parameterization performs better than conventional time and Euclidean arc-length ones.  We find that the system verification performance is better than 4 % error on skilled forgeries and 1 % error on random forgeries, and that its recognition performance is better than 1 % error rate, comparable to the best camera-based biometrics.
