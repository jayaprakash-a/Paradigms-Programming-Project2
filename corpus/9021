ASR SYSTEM MODELING FOR AUTOMATIC EVALUATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF DIALOGUE SYSTEMS
 ABSTRACT Though the field of spoken dialogue systems has developed quickly in the last decade, rapid design of dialogue strategies remains uneasy.  Several approaches to the problem of automatic strategy learning have been proposed and the use of Reinforcement Learning introduced by Levin and Pieraccini is becoming part of the state of the art in this area.  However, the quality of the strategy learned by the system depends on the definition of the optimization criterion and on the accuracy of the environment model.  In this paper, we propose to bring a model of an ASR system in the simulated environment in order to enhance the learned strategy.  To do so, we introduced recognition error rates and confidence levels produced by ASR systems in the optimization criterion.
