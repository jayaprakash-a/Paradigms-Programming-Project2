Improved Language Modeling for Statistical Machine Translation
 Abstract Statistical machine translation systems use a combination of one or more translation models and a language model.  While there is a significant body of research addressing the improvement of translation models, the problem of optimizing language models for a specific translation task has not received much attention.  Typically, standard word trigram models are used as an out-of-the-box component in a statistical machine translation system.  In this paper we apply language modeling techniques that have proved beneficial in automatic speech recognition to the ACL05 machine translation shared data task and demonstrate improvements over a baseline system with a standard language model.
