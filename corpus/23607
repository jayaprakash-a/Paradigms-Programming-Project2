Systematic design of unitary space-time constellations
 Abstract We propose a systematic method for creating constellations of unitary space-time signals for multipleantenna communication links.  Unitary space-time signals, which are orthonormal in time across the antennas, have been shown to be well-tailored to a Rayleigh fading channel where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the fading coefficients.  The signals can achieve low probability of error by exploiting multiple-antenna diversity.  Because the fading coefficients are not known, the criterion for creating and evaluating the constellation is nonstandard and differs markedly from the familiar
