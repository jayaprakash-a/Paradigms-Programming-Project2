A Study of Four-Fermion Final States with High Multiplicity at LEP The OPAL Collaboration
 Abstract A search for ` + `\Gamma qq (`=e,) four-fermion final states in high multiplicity events has been performed at p s m Z and above the Z peak at p s = 130 GeV and p s = 136 GeV.  The data taken with OPAL correspond to an integrated luminosity of 132. 4 pb\Gamma 1 and 5. 3 pb\Gamma 1 at p s m Z and p s = 130-136 GeV, respectively.  While at the Z resonance the data are in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions, we find more events than expected at p s = 130--136 GeV, especially in the + \Gamma qq channel, where 5 events remain after all cuts, with only 0. 6 predicted by the Monte Carlo simulation.  For all center-of-mass energies the observed shapes of the differential distributions are consistent with the predictions.
