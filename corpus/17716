Chapter 9 Adaptive cognitive systems
 123 9. 1 Introduction Our research on cognitive systems focuses on modeling and applying methods of unsupervised and reinforcement learning.  The general aim is to provide a methodological framework for theories of conceptual development, symbol grounding, communication among autonomous agents, and constructive learning.  We also work in close collaboration with other groups in our laboratory, e. g. , related to multimodal environments and sensory fusion.
