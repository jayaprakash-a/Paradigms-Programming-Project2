First Year Report Computer Laboratory
 My research interests are in the field of network security infrastructures, where the focus of my work is currently on intrusion detection & prevention, honeypot technology, traffic monitoring & analysis and behavioural modelling.  This is reflected in the projects I have worked on during my time in the Systems Research Group so far: Nprobe is one of the major research efforts conducted in the Systems Research Group, addressing several open issues in the field of network monitoring such as scalability problems when monitoring fast networks, space-efficient storage of traffic data, distributed monitoring, online and offline multi-protocol analysis, connection modelling and others.  Section 2 describes my involvement in the Nprobe project.  Honeycomb is a system for automated generation of intrusion detection signatures using honeypots; this project evolved out of my interest in intrusion detection, honeypots and contributions to the open source honeypot honeyd.  This work also touches on several of the current problems of security infrastructures: telling benign from malicious behaviour; distribution, aggregation and correlation of security-relevant information such as alerts, attack signatures and system configuration; reacting to intrusions, integration of different kinds of security-relevant computing devices; just to name a few.  Section 3 describes the Honeycomb project in detail.  Netdude is a framework for inspection and manipulation of network traffic captured in libpcap trace files and the topic of Section 4.  This project was started during my work on traffic normalisation as an intern at ACIRI, when we recognised the need for a tool that allows us to make specific modifications to trace files in order to test our normalisations.  Since then, a large amount of effort has gone into enabling not only editing in-the-small, but also scalable and robust handling of arbitrary large traces; a feature that currently no other toolset for trace file manipulation provides.
