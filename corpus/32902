Metric Calibration of a Stereo Rig
 Abstract We describe a method to determine affine and metric calibration for a stereo rig.  The method does not involve the use of calibration objects or special motions, but simply a single general motion of the rig with fixed parameters (i. e.  camera parameters and relative orientation of the camera pair).  The novel aspects of this work are: first, relating the distinguished objects of Euclidean geometry to fixed entities of a Euclidean transformation matrix; second, showing that these fixed entities are accessible from the conjugate Euclidean transformation arising from the projective transformation of the structure under a motion of the fixed stereo rig; third, a robust and automatic implementation of the method.  Results are included of affine and metric calibration and structure recovery using images of real scenes.
