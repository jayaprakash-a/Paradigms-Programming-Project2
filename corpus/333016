MULTI-SENSORY MICROPHONES FOR ROBUST SPEECH DETECTION, ENHANCEMENT AND RECOGNITION
 ABSTRACT In this paper, we present new hardware prototypes that integrate several heterogeneous sensors into a single headset and describe the underlying DSP techniques for robust speech detection, enhancement and recognition in highly non-stationary noisy environments.  We also speculate other business uses with this type of devices.
