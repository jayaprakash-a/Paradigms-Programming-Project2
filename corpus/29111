ABayesian Approach to Filtering JunkE-nk 4
 Abstract In addressing the growing problem of junkE-nk 2 on the Internet, we examine methods for the automated construction of filters to eliminate suchunwanted messages from a user's mail stream.  By casting this problem in a decision theoretic framework, we are able to make use of probabilistic learning methods inconjunc- tion with a notion of differential misclassification cost to produce filters which are especially appropriate for the nuances of this task.  While this may appear, at first, to be a straight-aigh ard text classification problem, we show that by consideringdomain-ri ecificfea- tures of this problem in addition to the raw text of E- 282 messages, we can produce much more accurate filters.  Finally,we show the efficacy of such filters in a real world usage scenario, arguing that this technology is mature enough for deployment.
