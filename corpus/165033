A HYBRID GMM/SVM APPROACH TO SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION
 ABSTRACT This paper proposes a classification scheme that incorporates statistical models and support vector machines.  A hybrid system which appropriately combines the advantages of both the generative and discriminant model paradigms is described and experimentally evaluated on a text-independent speaker recognition task in matched and mismatched training and test conditions.  Our results prove that the combination is beneficial in terms of performance and practical in terms of computation.  We report relative improvements of up to 25% reduction in identification error rate compared to the baseline statistical model.
