Game Theory with Restricted Strategies (DRAFT: Please do not circulate
).  Abstract We present a theory of multiplayer games in which each player chooses their strategy from a limited class that may be significantly weaker than the class of all mixed strategies.  As in much of AI and machine learning, such restrictions may be desirable for reasons of computational tractability.  We define and study the notions of restricted Nash equilibria, local restricted Nash equilibria, and restricted security strategies.  We illustrate a number of these concepts with two well-studied games from the literature, the War of Attrition and Pricebots games, in which both players are restricted to play mixed strategies that are mixtures of Gaussians.
