Chapter 2 WEIGHTED GRAMMAR TOOLS: THE GRM LIBRARY
 Abstract We describe the algorithmic and software design principles of a general grammar library designed for use in spoken-dialogue systems, speech synthesis, and other speech processing applications.  The library is a set of general-purpose software tools for constructing and modifying weighted finite-state acceptors and transducers representing grammars.  The tools can be used in particular to compile weighted contextdependent rewrite rules into weighted finite-state transducers, read and compile, when possible, weighted context-free grammars into weighted automata, and dynamically modify the compiled grammar automata.  The dynamic modifications allowed include: grammar switching, dynamic modification of rules, dynamic activation or non-activation of rules, and the use of dynamic lists.  Access to these features is essential in spoken-dialogue applications.  2. 1 Motivation We describe the algorithmic and software design principles of a general grammar library (GRM library) designed for use in spoken-dialogue systems, speech synthesis, and other speech processing applications.  Most grammars used in speech processing applications are weighted.  The use of grammar weights is crucial for building robust spoken-dialogue systems.  In speech recognition, grammar weights are combined with acoustic weights to rank different hypotheses for a given speech utterance [Rabiner and Juang 1993, Jelinek 1998].  Due to the high variability of the input speech signal, a robust grammar admits any hypothesis as a possible transcription with a certain degree of probability.
