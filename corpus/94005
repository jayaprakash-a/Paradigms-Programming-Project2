Competitive Learning With Floating-Gate Circuits
 Abstract---Competitive learning is a general technique for training clustering and classification networks.  We have developed an 11-transistor silicon circuit, that we term an automaximizing bump circuit, that uses silicon physics to naturally implement a similarity computation, local adaptation, simultaneous adaptation and computation and nonvolatile storage.  This circuit is an ideal building block for constructing competitive-learning networks.  We illustrate the adaptive nature of the automaximizing bump in two ways.  First, we demonstrate a silicon competitive-learning circuit that clusters one-dimensional (1-D) data.  We then illustrate a general architecture based on the automaximizing bump circuit; we show the effectiveness of this architecture, via software simulation, on a general clustering task.  We corroborate our analysis with experimental data from circuits fabricated in a 0. 35- m CMOS process.
