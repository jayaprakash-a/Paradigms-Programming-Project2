Homography Tensors: On Algebraic Entities that Represent Three Views of Static or Moving Planar Points
 Abstract We introducea3 # 3 # 3 tensor H ijk and its dual H ijk which represent the 2D projective mapping of points across threeprojections (views).  The tensor H ijk is a generalization of the well known 2D collineation matrix (homography matrix) and it concatenates two homography matrices to represent the joint mapping across three views.  The dual tensor H ijk concatenates two dual homography matrices (mappings of line space) and is responsible for representing the mapping associated with moving points along straight-line paths, i. e. , H ijk can berecoveredfrom line-of-sight measurements only.
