Granular Synthesis for Display of Time-Varying Probability Densities
 Abstract--- We present a method for displaying time-varying probabilistic information to users using an asynchronous granular synthesis technique.  We extend the basic synthesis technique to include distribution over waveform source, spatial position, pitch and time inside waveforms.  To enhance the synthesis in interactive contexts, we "quicken" the display by integrating predictions of user behaviour into the sonification.  This includes summing the derivatives of the distribution during exploration of static densities, and using Monte-Carlo sampling to predict future user states in nonlinear dynamic systems.  These techniques can be used to improve user performance in continuous control systems and in the interactive exploration of high dimensional spaces.  This technique provides feedback from users potential goals, and their progress toward achieving them; modulating the feedback with quickening can help shape the users actions toward achieving these goals.  We have applied these techniques to a simple nonlinear control problem as well as to the sonification of on-line probabilistic gesture recognition.  We are applying these displays to mobile, gestural interfaces, where visual display is often impractical.  The granular synthesis approach is theoretically elegant and easily applied in contexts where dynamic probabilistic displays are required.
