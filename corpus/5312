Topology Free Hidden Markov Models: Application to Background Modeling
 Abstract Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are increasingly being used in computer vision for applications such as: gesture analysis, action recognition from video, and illumination modeling.  Their use involves an off-line learning step that is used as a basis for on-line decision making (i. e.  a stationarity assumption on the model parameters).  But, realworld applications are often non-stationary in nature.  This leads to the need for a dynamic mechanism to learn and update the model topology as well as its parameters.  This paper presents a new framework for HMM topology and parameter estimation in an online, dynamic fashion.  The topology and parameter estimation is posed as a model selection problem with an MDL prior.  Online modifications to the topology are made possible by incorporating a state splitting criterion.  To demonstrate the potential of the algorithm, the background modeling problem is considered.  Theoretical validation and real experiments are presented.
