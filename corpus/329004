Video Google: A Text Retrieval Approach to Object Matching in Videos
 Abstract We describe an approach to object and scene retrieval which searches for and localizes all the occurrences of a user outlined object in a video.  The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion.  The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors.  The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used.  The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google.  The method is illustrated for matching on two full length feature films.
