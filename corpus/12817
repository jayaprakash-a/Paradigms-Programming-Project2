Approximate Explanation of Reasoning in Bayesian Networks
 Abstract We address the question of explaining the computation of the posterior probability of a node in a Bayesian network.  In polytrees, this probability can be explained by decomposing it into a product of causal terms (from the ancestors) and diagnostic terms (from the descendants).  In models with loops, this decomposition is in general not valid.  To proceed, we propose a scheme to approximate the posterior of a loopy model locally by a polytree.  In this approximating model, the node probability can again be decomposed into causal and diagnostic terms.  This decomposition can then be used as a rough explanation of reasoning for a user.  The method is illustrated by numerical examples.
