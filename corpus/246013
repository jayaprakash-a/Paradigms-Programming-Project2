Image Segmentation and Residual Coding for Very Low Bit Rate Compression
 Abstract To achieve very low bit rate compression a new robust segmentation method is employed to define the most important regions of the image.  The region contours are then approximated with polygonal lines and transmitted together with the color of the region.  The discrete wavelet transform is used to compress the residual image which represents mostly texture and noise.  The overall procedure proves to be an effective compression scheme.  The reconstructed images show satisfactory visual appearance at compression ratios higher than 100:1 for gray level images and 150:1 for color images.
