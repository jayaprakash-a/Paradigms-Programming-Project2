Real-Time Feature Tracking and Outlier Rejection with Changes in Illumination
 Abstract We develop an efficient algorithm to track point features supported by image patches undergoing affine deformations and changes in illumination.  The algorithm is based on a combined model of geometry and photometry that is used to track features as well as to detect outliers in a hypothesis testing framework.  The algorithm runs in real time on a personal computer, and is available to the public.
