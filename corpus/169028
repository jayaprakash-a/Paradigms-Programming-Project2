Measuring the Functional Load of Phonological Contrasts
 Frequency counts are a measure of how much use a language makes of a linguistic unit, such as a phoneme or word.  However, what is often important is not the units themselves, but the contrasts between them.  A measure is therefore needed for how much use a language makes of a contrast, i. e.  the functional load (FL) of the contrast.  We generalize previous work in linguistics and speech recognition and propose a family of measures for the FL of several phonological contrasts, including phonemic oppositions, distinctive features, suprasegmentals, and phonological rules.  We then test it for robustness to changes of corpora.
