2nd Annual IEEE International Conference on Image Processing
 ABSTRACT We describe an architecture for efficient and accurate linear decomposition of an image into scale and orientation subbands.  The basis functions of this decomposition are directional derivative operators of any desired order.  We describe the construction and implementation of the transform.  1 Differential algorithms are used in a wide variety of image processing problems.  For example, gradient measurements are used as a first stage of many edge detection, depth-from-stereo, and optical flow algorithms.  Higher-order derivatives have also been found useful in these applications.  Extraction of these derivative quantities may be viewed as a decomposition of a signal via terms of a local Taylor series expansions [1].  Another widespread tool in signal and image processing is multi-scale decomposition.  Apart from the advantages of decomposing signals into information at different scales, the typical recursive form of these algorithms leads to large improvements in computational efficiency.  Many authors have combined multi-scale decompositions with differential measurements (eg. , [2, 3]).  In these cases, a multi-scale pyramid is constructed, and then differential operators (typically, differences of neighboring pixels) are applied to the subbands of the pyramid.  Since both the pyramid decomposition and the derivative operation are linear and shift-invariant, we may combine them into a single operation.  The advantages of doing so are that the resulting derivatives may be more accurate (see [4]).  In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient decomposition architecture for combining these two operations.  The decomposition is the latest incarnation of 1 Source code and filter kernels for implementation of the steerable pyramid are available via anonymous ftp from ftp.
