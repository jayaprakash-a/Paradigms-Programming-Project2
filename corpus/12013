On Satellite Vision-Aided Robotics Experiment
 Abstract This contribution describes the vision-based robotic control (VBRC) experiments executed on the Japanese research satellite ETS-VII.  The VBRC experiments were designed to enhance image quality, refine calibration of different system components, facilitate robotoperation by automatically refining the robot-pose and provide data for robot-calibration.
