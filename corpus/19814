Bayesian probabilistic extensions of a deterministic classification model \Lambda
 Summary This paper extends deterministic models for Boolean regression within a Bayesian framework.  For a given binary criterion variable Y and a set of k binary predictor variables X 1 ; : : : ; X k , a Boolean regression model is a conjunctive (or disjunctive) logical combination consisting of a subset S of the X variables, which predicts Y .  Formally, Boolean regression models include a specification of a k-dimensional binary indicator vector (` 1 ; : : : ; ` k ) with ` j = 1 iff X j 2 S.  In a probabilistic extension, a parameter is added which represents the probability of the predicted value ^ y i and the observed value y i to differ (for any observation i).  Within Bayesian estimation, a posterior distribution of the parameters (` 1 ; : : : ; ` k ; ) is looked for.  The advantages of such a Bayesian approach include a proper account for the uncertainty in the model estimates and various possibilities for model checking (using posterior predictive checks).  We illustrate in an example using real data.
