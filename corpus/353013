Estimating Dataset Size Requirements for Classifying DNA Microarray Data
 ABSTRACT A statistical methodology for estimating dataset size requirements for classifying microarray data using learning curves is introduced.  The goal is to use existing classi cation results to estimate dataset size requirements for future classi cation experiments and to evaluate the gain in accuracy and signi cance of classi ers built with additional data.  The method is based on tting inverse power-law models to construct empirical learning curves.  It also includes a permutation test procedure to assess the statistical signi cance of classi cation performance for a given dataset size.  This procedure is applied to several molecular classication problems representing a broad spectrum of levels of complexity.
