Classification of Human Body Motion
 Abstract The classication of human body motion is a difcult problem.  In particular, the automatic segmentation of sequences containing more than one class of motion is challenging.  An effective approach is to use mixed discrete/continuous states to couple perception with classication.  A spline contour is used to track the outline of the person.  We show that for a quasi-periodic human body motion, an autoregressive process is a suitable model for the contour dynamics.  This can then be used as a dynamical model for mixed state CONDENSATION ltering, switching automatically between different motion classes.  We have developed ^Partial Importance Sampling~ to enhance the efciency of the mixed state CONDENSATION lter.  It is also shown here that the importance sampling can be done in linear time, in place of the previous quadratic algorithm.  ~Tying~ of discrete states is used to obtain further efciency improvements.  Automatic segmentation is demonstrated on video sequences of aerobic exercises.  Performance is promising, but there remains a residual misclassication rate and possible explanations for this are discussed.
