Reasoning with Models \Lambda
 Abstract We develop a model-based approach to reasoning, in which the knowledge base is represented as a set of models (satisfying assignments) rather then a logical formula, and the set of queries is restricted.  We show that for every propositional knowledge base (KB) there exists a set of characteristic models with the property that a query is true in KB if and only if it is satisfied by the models in this set.  We fully characterize a set of theories for which the model-based representation is compact and provides efficient reasoning.  These include cases where the formula-based representation does not support efficient reasoning.  In addition, we consider the model-based approach to abductive reasoning and show that for any propositional KB, reasoning with its model-based representation yields an abductive explanation in time that is polynomial in its size.  Some of our technical results make use of the Monotone Theory, a new characterization of Boolean functions introduced in [Bsh93].  The notion of restricted queries is inherent to our approach.  This is a wide class of queries for which reasoning is very efficient and exact, even when the model-based representation KB provides only an approximate representation of the "world".  Moreover, we show that the theory developed here generalizes the model-based approach to reasoning with Horn theories [KKS93], and captures even the notion of reasoning with Hornapproximations [SK91].  Our result characterizes the Horn theories for which the approach suggested in [KKS93] is useful and the phenomena observed there, regarding the relative sizes of the formula-based representation and model-based representation of KB is explained and put in a wider context.
