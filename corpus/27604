Recovering shape and distribution of delays of repetitive responses in strong noise
 Abstract In studies of repetitive responses, such as evoked responses in electro/magnetoencephalography, a signal is often of the same order of magnitude or even weaker than the noise.  In order to recover the original signal shape, people average over many trials.  This approach is problematic when the responses have variable delays, as the shape of the averaged signal become blurred.  In this paper we suggest a method for recovering the original form of the signal and the probability distribution of delays using the average of non-linearly transformed responses.  1 Derivation of the Method Let the observed evoked response be a random process x(t) = s(t #) + #(t) where s(t) is an underlying deterministic signal, # is a random delay distributed according to the probability density f(# ), and #(t) is stationary zero mean noise with standard deviation # n .  We wish to estimate s(t); f(#) and # n from multiple realizations (trials) of x(t).  We begin with the following observation.  For a given deterministic function r(t), shifted randomly by # , the corresponding expectation can be expressed pressed E[r(t # )] = r(t) # f(#) ; where \#" means convolution.  In order to recover the original signal shape and the probability distribution of delays, we will use expectations E[x a (t)], which can be estimated by averaging x a (t) across trials.  Using the fact that E[#(t)] = E[s(t)#(t)] = E[s 2 (t)#(t)] = 0 ; it is easy to get relations of the form E[x a (t)] = F a (s; f; # n ) ; a = 1; 2; 3 (1) where in particular F 1 = s(t) # f(#) F 2 = s 2 (t) # f(#) + # 2 n (2) F 3 = s 3 (t) # f(#) + 3# 2 n s(t) # f(#) We can recover the unknowns s(t); f(#) and # n by solving the system of equations (1), say, in least square sense, i. e.  to minimize the error function R(s; f; # n ) # 3 X a=1 c a # # #E[x a (t)] F a (s; f; # n ) # # # 2 (3) where k # k is the L 2 (or l 2 ) norm of a function of continuous (or discrete) time, and c a are some non-negative weights.
