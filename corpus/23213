Action Refinement in Reinforcement Learning by Probability Smoothing
 Abstract In many reinforcement learning applications, the set of possible actions can be partitioned by the programmer into subsets of similar actions.  This paper presents a technique for exploiting this form of prior information to speed up model-based reinforcement learning.  We call it an action refinement method, because it treats each subset of similar actions as a single "abstract" action early in the learning process and then later "refines" the abstract action into individual actions as more experience is gathered.  Our method estimates the transition probabilities P (s 0
