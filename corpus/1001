An Experimental Comparison of Range Image Segmentation Algorithms
 Abstract A methodology for evaluating range image segmentation algorithms is proposed.  This methodology involves (a) a common set of 40 laser range finder images and 40 structured light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth and (b) a set of defined performance metrics for instances of correctly segmented, missed and noise regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered geometry.  A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth.  Four research groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches.
