Face Recognition by Elastic Bunch Graph Matching
 Abstract We present a system for recognizing human faces from single images out of a large database containing one image per person.  Faces are represented by labeled graphs, based on a Gabor wavelet transform.  Image graphs of new faces are extracted by an elastic graph matching process and can be compared by a simple similarity function.  The system differs from the preceding one [1] in three respects.  Phase information is used for accurate node positioning.  Object-adapted graphs are used to handle large rotations in depth.  Image graph extraction is based on a novel data structure, the bunch graph, which is constructed from a small set of sample image graphs.
