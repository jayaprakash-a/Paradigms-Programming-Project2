Representations and Algorithms for Exact Time-Dependent MDPs
 Abstract We describe an extension of the Markov decision process model where a continuous time dimension is included in the state space.  This allows for the representation and exact solution of a wide range of problems in which transitions or rewards vary over time.  We examine problems based on route planning with public transportation and telescope observation scheduling.
