Visualizing the embedding of objects in Euclidean space
 ABSTRACT Matrices representing dissimilarities within a set of objects are familiar in mathematics, statistics and psychology.  In this paper we describe XGvis, a software system which accepts diverse input data, such as graphs and multivariate data, develops a dissimilarity matrix from the data, and then iteratively and interactively embeds objects in a Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension.  Using a technique called multidimensional scaling, objects are positioned so that their pairwise distances match the target dissimilarities as well as possible.  Users can interact with XGobi, a software system for visualizing highdimensional data, to browse the resulting embeddings.  Mathematicians and statisticians have found XGvis to be useful for discovering and exploring structure.  XGvis runs under the X Window System TM .
