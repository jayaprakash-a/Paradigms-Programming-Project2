Cortical Map Development Driven by Spontaneous Retinal Activity Waves
 Abstract.  Correlation-based learning (CBL) models have been quite successful when applied to the activity driven development of cortical orientation selectivity (OR) or ocular dominance (OD) maps.  We ask under which conditions waves of spontaneous activity as have been observed in the developing retina may provide the proper activity to drive the CBL process.  We demonstrate that the currently assumed statistics of spontaneous activity waves may drive OD and OR development only, if (i) the visual pathways interact before they reach the cortex, and (ii) if the CBL model involves nonlinear mechanisms or constraints to couple OD and OR development.  Finally, simulated cortical maps are examined.
