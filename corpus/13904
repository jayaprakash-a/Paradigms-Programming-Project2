Networks of integrate-and-"re neurons using Rank Order Coding B: Spike timing dependent plasti ity and emergen e of orientation sele tivity
 Abstract Rank Order Coding is an alternative to conventional rate coding schemes that uses the order in which a neuron's inputs "re to en ode information.  In a visual system framework, we simulated the asyn hronous waves of retinal spikes produ ed in response to natural s enes and used them to stimulate integrate-and-"re V1 neurons that implemented a standard learning rule based on spike timing.  After propagating thousands of images, orientation like re eptive "elds arise in these neurons despite the fa t that the input neurons never "red more than on e.  We also analyze the biologi al plausibility of su h a network.
