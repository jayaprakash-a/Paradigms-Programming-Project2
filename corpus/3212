Rapid adaptation to internal states as a coding strategy in visual cortex?
 Adaptation is a prominent feature of biological neuronal systems.  A common interpretation of adaptation in terms of function is that it provides exibility for a neuronal system to per form well under varying external conditions, for example by adjusting the input/output relation of a sensory system with reference to the ensemble of stimuli the organism currently perceives. This interpretation, however, only applies if the time-scale of adaptation is slower than the time-scale at which the environment changes.  Experimentally it is observed, however, that adaptation can be very rapid.  Spike-frequency adaptation of cortical neurons, for example, occurs on a time-scale of B100ms. Here we show that those ra id ada tation rocesses can also be understood within the framework of information theory.  We start with the hy othesis that neuronal codes are designed to o timize the information a neuronal re resentation conveys about an in ut stimulus for any increasing time window beginning with stimulus onset, and we show that this im lies a ra id ada tation of the neuronal code on the time-scale of stimulus resentation.  Ada tation, however, does not occur because the state of the environmentchanges. Rather it is a reaction to changes oftheorganismsowninternalstate,e. g. thelevelofnoiseinthe neuronal re resentation.  We a ly this a roach to a model of an orientation hy ercolumn in the rimary visual cortex, and redict that inter-columnar interactions should ada t on the time-scale of a ty ical xation eriod (B300ms).
