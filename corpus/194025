Detection of Human Faces from Discriminative Regions
 Abstract We propose a robust method for face detection based on the assumption that face can be represented by arrangements of automatically detectable discriminative regions.  The appearance of face is modeled statistically in terms of local photometric information and the spatial relationship of the discriminative regions.  The spatial relationship between these regions serves mainly as a preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that a face is present in a particular position.  The final decision is carried out using the complete information from the whole image patch.  The results are very promising.
