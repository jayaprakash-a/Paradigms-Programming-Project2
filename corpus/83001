On the convergence of a clustering algorithm for protein-coding regions in microbial genomes
 Abstract Motivation: As the number of fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes continues to grow rapidly, computational methods for reliably detecting protein-coding regions become even more important.  Audic and Claverie (1998) Proc.  Natl Acad.  Sci.  USA, 95, 10026--10031, have proposed a clustering algorithm for protein-coding regions in microbial genomes.  The algorithm is based on three Markov models of order k associated with subsequences extracted from a given genome.  The parameters of the three Markov models are recursively updated by the algorithm which, in simulations, always appear to converge to a unique stable partition of the genome.  The partition corresponds to three kinds of regions: (1) coding on the direct strand, (2) coding on the complementary strand, (3) non-coding.  Results: Here we provide an explanation for the convergence of the algorithm by observing that it is essentially a form of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm applied to the corresponding mixture model.  We also provide a partial justification for the uniqueness of the partition based on identifiability.  Other possible variations and improvements are briefly discussed.
