Bayesian Multilevel Estimation with Poststratification: State-Level Estimates from National Polls
 Abstract We fit a multilevel logistic regression model for the mean of a binary response variable conditional on poststratification cells.  This approach combines the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation with the population information used in poststratification (see Gelman and Little (1997)).  To validate the method, we apply it to U. S pre-election polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables.  We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes.  The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science.  We envision the most important usage of this method, not in forecasting elections, but in estimating public opinion on a variety of issues at the state level.
