A Real-Time Algorithm for Mobile Robot Mapping With Applications to Multi-Robot and 3D Mapping
 Abstract We present an incremental method for concurrent mapping and localization for mobile robots equipped with 2D laser range finders.  The approach uses a fast implementation of scan-matching for mapping, paired with a sample-based probabilistic method for localization.  Compact 3D maps are generated using a multi-resolution approach adopted from the computer graphics literature, fed by data from a dual laser system.  Our approach builds 3D maps of large, cyclic environments in real-time.  It is remarkably robust.  Experimental results illustrate that accurate maps of large, cyclic environments can be generated even in the absence of any odometric data.
