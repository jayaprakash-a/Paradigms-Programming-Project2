A FLOATING-GATE TECHNOLOGY FOR DIGITAL CMOS PROCESSES
 ABSTRACT We discuss the possibility of developing high-quality floatinggate memories and circuits in digital CMOS technologies that have only one layer of polysilicon.  Here, the primary concern is whether or not we can get adequate control-gate linearity from MOS capacitors.  We employ two experimental proceedures to address this issue and find acceptable floating-gate circuit behavior with MOS capacitors.  First, we simultaniously characterize a MOS capacitor and a linear capacitor; the experimental data show that MOS capacitors behave similarly to linear capacitors over a finite, but usable range.  Second, we characterize two typical floating-gate MOS circuit primatives, a floating-gate amplifier and a multiple-input translinear element, two basic circuits that rely heavily on the linearity of the capacitors that couple into the floating gates.  Our measurements show that floatinggate circuits with MOS-capacitor control gates behave like their counterparts built with linear capacitors over specific regions of operation.
