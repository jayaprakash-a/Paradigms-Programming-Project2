Kerneltron: Support Vector `Machine' in Silicon
 Abstract---Detection of complex objects in streaming video poses two fundamental challenges: training from sparse data with proper generalization across variations in the object class and the environment; and the computational power required of the trained classifier running real-time.  The Kerneltron supports the generalization performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and offers the bandwidth and efficiency of a massively parallel architecture.  The mixed-signal very large-scale integration (VLSI) processor is dedicated to the most intensive of SVM operations: evaluating a kernel over large numbers of vectors in high dimensions.  At the core of the Kerneltron is an internally analog, fine-grain computational array performing externally digital inner-products between an incoming vector and each of the stored support vectors.  The three-transistor unit cell in the array combines single-bit dynamic storage, binary multiplication, and zero-latency analog accumulation.  Precise digital outputs are obtained through oversampled quantization of the analog array outputs combined with bit-serial unary encoding of the digital inputs.  The 256 input, 128 vector Kerneltron measures 3mm 3mmin0. 5 m CMOS, delivers 6. 5 GMACS throughput at 5. 9 mW power, and attains 8-bit output resolution.
