Thermal characterization of defects in aircraft structures via spatially controlled heat application
 ABSTRACT Recent advances in thermal imaging technology have spawned a number of new thermal NDE techniques that provide quantitative information about flaws in aircraft structures.  Thermography has a number of advantages as an inspection technique.  It is a totally noncontacting, nondestructive, imaging technology capable of inspecting a large area in a matter of a few seconds.  The development of fast, inexpensive image processors have aided in the attractiveness of thermography as an NDE technique.  These image processors have increased the signal to noise ratio of thermography and facilitated significant advances in post-processing.  The resulting digital images enable archival records for comparison with later inspections thus providing a means of monitoring the evolution of damage in a particular structure.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Langley Research Center has developed a thermal NDE technique designed to image a number of potential flaws in aircraft structures.  The technique involves injecting a small, spatially controlled heat flux into the outer surface of an aircraft.  Images of fatigue cracking, bond integrity and material loss due to corrosion are generated from measurements of the induced surface temperature variations.  This paper will present a discussion of the development of the thermal imaging system as well as the techniques used to analyze the resulting thermal images.  Spatial tailoring of the heat coupled with the analysis techniques represent a significant improvement in the delectability of flaws over conventional thermal imaging.
