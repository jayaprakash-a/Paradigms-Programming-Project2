Associative memory based on parametrically coupled chaotic elements
 Abstract In this paper, we propose an associative memory system based on parametrically coupled chaotic elements.  The proposed system is obtained by adding a new parameter control to our previously proposed system.  A chaotic activity in an early association stage makes an efficient association over the memories that are stored by means of autocorrelational learning.  When the system successfully recalls the target memory, the system's motion is dominated by a spatially coherent oscillation, while unstable motions remain when the system fails to make the association.  In addition, the system has a large memory capacity.  A comparison between the proposed system and an approach with a nonmonotonic transfer function is also shown.
