A Neural-Network based Approach for Recognition of Pose and Motion Gestures on a Mobile Robot
 involve motion (such as waving).  Gestures are recognized in real-time at approximate frame rate, using neural networks.  A fast, color-based tracking algorithm enables the robot to track and follow a person reliably through office environments with drastically changing lighting conditions.  Results are reported in the context of an interactive clean-up task, where a person guides the robot to specific locations that need to be cleaned, and the robot picks up trash which it then delivers to the nearest trash-bin.
