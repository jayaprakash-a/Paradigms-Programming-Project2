Linearizable Read/Write Objects \Lambda
 Abstract We study the cost of implementing linearizable read/write objects for shared-memory multiprocessors under various assumptions on the available timing information.  We take as cost measure the worst-case response time of performing an operation in distributed implementations of virtual shared memory consisting of such objects.  It is assumed that processes have clocks that run at the same rate as real time and all messages incur a delay in the range [d\Gamma u; d] for some known constants u and d, 0 u d.  In the perfect clocks model, where processes have perfectly synchronized clocks and every message incurs a delay of exactly d, we present a family of optimal linearizable implementations, parameterized by a constant fi, 0 fi 1, for which the worst-case response times for read and write operations are fid and (1\Gamma fi)d, respectively.  The parameter fi may be appropriately chosen to account for the relative frequencies of read and write operations.  Our main result is the first known linearizable implementation for the imperfect clocks model, where clocks are not initially synchronized and message delays can vary, i. e. , u ? 0; it achieves worst-case response times of less than 4u+b (b ? 0 is an arbitrarily small constant) and d + 3u for read and write operations, respectively.  This implementation employs novel synchronization techniques in order to utilize the lower bound on message delay time and achieve bounds on worst-case response times that depend on the message delay uncertainty u.  For a wide range of values of u, these bounds improve upon previously known ones for implementations that support consistency conditions even weaker than linearizability.
