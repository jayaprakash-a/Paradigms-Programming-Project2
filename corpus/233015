The Ice Rink Problem
 ABSTRACT Aerial search and rescue (or bombing) missions frequently have to locate a target within some prescribed area, running a search pattern that is constrained by the flight characteristics of the aircraft.  The sweep is done in nearly straight lines at high speed, with the craft's sensors monitoring a narrow strip of ground underneath the craft; in between sweeps, the craft slows down for turns that are much wider than the sensor footprint.  A similar task with a simpler geometry consists of cleaning an ice rink.  We prove that the method used in ice rinks (the "Zamboni algorithm") is optimal and use it to develop heuristics for the more general task of sweeping an arbitrary simple polygon.  We provide upper bounds on the performance of some of our heuristics and give the results of experiments showing that our heuristics produce solutions within a few percent of optimal.
