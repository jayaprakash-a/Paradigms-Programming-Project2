REFINEMENT OF A STRUCTURED LANGUAGE MODEL y
 ABSTRACT A new language model for speech recognition inspired by linguistic analysis is presented.  The model develops hidden hierarchical structure incrementally and uses it to extract meaningful information from the word history --- thus enabling the use of extended distance dependencies --- in an attempt to complement the locality of currently used n-gram Markov models.  The model, its probabilistic parametrization, a reestimation algorithm for the model parameters and a set of experiments meant to evaluate its potential for speech recognition are presented.
