AN ADAPTIVE VISUAL TRACKING SENSOR WITH A HYSTERETIC WINNER-TAKE-ALL NETWORK
 ABSTRACT We present a CMOS VLSI image sensor containing a 26 26 array of differentiating adaptive photoreceptors, combined with a current-mode hysteretic winner-take-all (WTA) network, able to detect and track high-contrast targets moving within its field of view.  The device, implemented using standard 0. 8 m CMOS technology, dissipates 600 W, with a power supply voltage of 5 V.  Its WTA outputs can be read out using either analog position-to-voltage circuits, or digital address encoders.  Photoreceptor voltages with sustained and transient responses, can be read out serially, using an on-chip scanner, or in a random-access mode, using address decoders.  Combining digital output position encoders and input address decoders it is possible to read only the location of the winning pixel, or a small window around the winning pixel (e. g.  using a microcontroller), thus implementing a selective attention read-out mechanism.
