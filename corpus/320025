When Are Two Protocols the Same?
 Abstract.  A number of protocols based on the formal dialogue games of philosophy have recently been proposed for interactions between autonomous agents.  Several of these proposals purport to assist agents engaged in the same types of interactions, such as persuasions and negotiations, and are superficially different.  How are we to determine whether or not these proposals are substantially different? This chapter considers this question and explores several alternative definitions of equivalence of protocols.
