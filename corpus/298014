A Mathematical Theory of Primal Sketch and Sketchability
 Abstract In this paper, we present a mathematical theory for Marr's primal sketch.  The theory has four components.  The first component is a primal sketch model for natural images, which integrates the descriptive Markov random field model and the generative wavelet model.  The former is applied to textural locations without distinguishable elements, called non-sketchable, and the latter is applied to geometric locations, called sketchable.  The second component is a sketching pursuit process which coordinates the competition between two pursuit algorithms: the matching pursuit [9] and the filter pursuit [14], or the competition of the two families of models that seek to explain the image by bases and filters respectively.  The third component is a theoretical definition of sketchability which states a critical condition, and thus a dividing point, for our perceptual jumps between texture and geometry.  The fourth component is to learn a generic dictionary of image primitives, or textons in Julesz's term, for natural images.  Our dictionary is found to be far more effective than conventional Gabor and LoG bases.  Our model is not only extremely parsimonious for image representation, but produces meaningful sketches, as Marr hoped for, over a large number (4 5 A? ) of generic images.
