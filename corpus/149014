Entropy Numbers of Linear Function Classes
 Abstract This paper collects together a miscellany of results originally motivated by the analysis of the generalization performance of the "maximum-margin" algorithm due to Vapnik and others.  The key feature of the paper is its operator-theoretic viewpoint.  New bounds on covering numbers for classes related to Maximum Margin classes are derived directly without making use of a combinatorial dimension such as the VC-dimension.  Specific contents of the paper include: # a new and self-contained proof of Maurey's theorem and some generalizations with small explicit values of constants; # bounds on the covering numbers of maximum margin classes suitable for the analysis of their generalization performance; # the extension of such classes to those induced by balls in quasi-Banach spaces (such as ` p norms with 0 < p < 1).  # extension of results on the covering numbers of convex hulls of basis functions to p-convex hulls (0 < p # 1); # an appendix containing the tightest known bounds on the entropy numbers of the identity operator between ` n p1 and ` n p2 (0 < p 1 < p 2 # 1).
