ANALOG INTEGRATED 2-D OPTICAL FLOW SENSOR WITH PROGRAMMABLE PIXELS
 ABSTRACT We present a framework for real-time visual motion perception consisting of a novel analog VLSI optical flow sensor with reconfigurable pixels, connected in feedback with a controlling processor.  The 2-D sensor array is composed of motion processing pixels that can be individually recruited to form dynamic ensembles that collectively compute visual motion.  This flexible framework lends itself to the emulation of multi-layer recurrent network architectures for highlevel processing of visual motion.  In particular, attentional modulation can easily be incorporated in the visual motion processing.  We show a simple example of visual tracking that demonstrates the potential of the framework.  1.  MOTIVATION Estimation of visual motion is an important aspect of visual processing in freely behaving and cognitive autonomous systems.  However, it is difficult to obtain a reliable estimate because visual motion is inherently ambiguous.  The ambiguity can be resolved by estimating the visual motion in terms of a model that relates the observed spatio-temporal brightness changes in a visual scene with the underlying physical world producing it.  The better the model, the better is the understanding of the visual scene, and so the better is the estimate of visual motion.  The selection of the model is a trade-off between computational cost and functional reliability.  Simple models, such as Normal Flow, offer computationally trackablity and real-time performance at the cost of poor estimates under some conditions.  Elaborate models, on the other hand, provide more generally acceptable results but are computationally expensive.  For example, the estimation of visual motion of an object usually requires the integration of visual information across its outline, an operation that requires dynamical recombination of the individual units of a retinotopic array of local motion processors.
