An O(n log log n ) Learning Algorithm for DNF under the Uniform Distribution
 Abstract We show that a DNF with terms of size at most d can be approximated by a function with at most d O(d log 1=") non zero Fourier coefficients such that the expected error squared, with respect to the uniform distribution, is at most ''.  This property is used to derive a learning algorithm for DNF, under the uniform distribution.  The learning algorithm uses queries and learns, with respect to the uniform distribution, a DNF with terms of size at most d in time polynomial in n and d O(d log 1=") .  The interesting implications are for the case when '' is constant.  In this case our algorithm learns a DNF with a polynomial number of terms in time n O(log log n) , and a DNF with terms of size at most O(log n= log log n) in polynomial time.
