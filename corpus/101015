Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering
 Abstract Spectral clustering has been theoretically analyzed and empirically proven useful.  Still, there are some open issues which have not been addressed properly: (i) Selecting the appropriate scale of analysis, (ii) Handling multi-scale data, (iii) Clustering with irregular background clutter, and, (iv) Finding automatically the number of groups.  In this paper we address all the above issues.  We first suggest an automatic way to incorporate the local scale for each data point into the point-to-point distance estimation.  We show that this local scaling leads to better clustering performance especially when the data includes multiple scales and when the clusters are placed within a cluttered background.  We further suggest a scheme which exploits the structure of the eigenvectors to automatically infer the number of groups.  This scheme turns out to lead to a new spectral clustering algorithm which requires less user intervention.
