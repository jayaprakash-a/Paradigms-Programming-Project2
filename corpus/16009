Robust Real-Time Face Detection
 Abstract.  This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates.  There are three key contributions.  The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly.  The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features.  The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions.  A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented.  The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al. , 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al. , 2000).  Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.
