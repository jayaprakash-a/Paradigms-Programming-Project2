SPEECH SYNTHESIS USING NON-UNIFORM UNITS IN THE VERBMOBIL PROJECT
 ABSTRACT We describe a concatenative speech synthesiser for British English which uses the HADIFIX [8] inventory structure originally developed for German by Portele.  An inventory of non-uniform units was investigated with the aim of improving segmental quality compared to diphones.  A combination of soft (diphone) and hard concatenation was used, which allowed a dramatic reduction in inventory size.  We also present a unit selection algorithm which selects an optimum sequence of units from this inventory for a given phoneme sequence.  The work described is part of the concept-to-speech synthesiser for the language and speech project Verbmobil [12] which is funded by the German Ministry of Science (BMBF).
