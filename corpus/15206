When is now? Perception of simultaneity
 We address the following question: Is there a dierence (D) between the amount of time for auditory and visual stimuli to be perceived ? On each of 1000 trials, observers were presented with a light ^ sound pair, separated by a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between 250 ms (sound rst) and # 250 ms.  Observers indicated if the light^ sound pair came on simultaneously by pressing one of two (yes or no) keys.  The SOA most likely to yield armative responses was dened as the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS).  PSS values were between 21 ms (i. e.  sound 21ms before light) and #150 ms.  Evidence is presented that each PSS is observer specic.  In a second experiment, each observer was tested using two observer ^ stimulus distances.  The resultant PSS values are highly correlated (r ^ 0:954, p ^ 0:003), suggesting that each observer ' s PSS is stable.  PSS values were signicantly aected by observer ^ stimulus distance, suggesting that observers do not take account of changes in distance on the resultant dierence in arrival times of light and sound.  The dierence RT d in simple reaction time to single visual and auditory stimuli was also estimated; no evidence that RT d is observer specic or stable was found.  The implications of these ndings for the perception of multisensory stimuli are discussed.
