Inertially Assisted Stereo Tracking for an Outdoor Rover
 Abstract Ego-motion (self-motion) of the cameraisaconsiderable problem in outdoor rover applications.  Stereo tracking of a single moving target is a dicult problem that becomes even more challenging when rough terrain causes significant and high-acceleration motion of the camera in the world.  This paper discusses the use of inertial measurements to estimate camera ego-motion and the use of these estimates to augment stereotracking.  Some initial results from an outdoor rover will be presented, illustrating the ecacy of the method.  The method causes fast but predictable image location transients, but reduces the amplitude of image location transients due to the rough terrain.
