Proposal and Demonstration of Link Connectivity Assessment based Enhancements to Routing in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks
 Abstract Routing is a challenge in dynamically changing network of mobile devices.  Proliferating ad-hoc network based applications have greatly increased the need for a robust routing protocol.  Inter-vehicle communication, for instance, has a huge scope in terms of potential applications targeting improvement in driving safety and convenience.  However, because of associated challenges like mobility and hostile driving conditions, ad-hoc multi-hop communication needs to be supported by a robust routing protocol.  In this paper, the application of link-connectivity assessment to efficient ad-hoc routing is investigated and demonstrated.
