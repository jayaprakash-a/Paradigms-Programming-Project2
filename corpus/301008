Active inference in concept learning
 Abstract People are active experimenters, constantly seeking new information relevant to their goals.  A reasonable approach to active information gathering is to ask questions and conduct experiments that minimize the expected state of uncertainty, or maximize the expected information gain, given current beliefs (Fedorov, 1972; MacKay, 1992; Oaksford & Chater, 1994).  In this paper we present results on an exploratory experiment designed to study people's active information gathering behavior on a concept learning task.  The results of the experiment suggest subjects' behavior may be explained well from the point of view of Bayesian information maximization.
