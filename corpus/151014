Bayesian Object Localisation in Images
 Abstract A Bayesian approach to intensity-based object localisation is presented that employs a learned probabilistic model of image filter-bank output, applied via Monte Carlo methods, to escape the inefficiency of exhaustive search.  An adequate probabilistic account of image data requires intensities both in the foreground (ie over the object), and in the background, to be modelled.  Some previous approaches to object localisation by Monte Carlo methods have used models which, we claim, do not fully address the issue of the statistical independence of image intensities.  It is addressed here by applying to each image a bank of filters whose outputs are approximately statistically independent.
