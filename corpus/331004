Large deviations bounds for empirical processes
 Abstract - Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds on speeds of convergence of empirical means to their expectations have been continuously improved over the years.  The result obtained by M.  Talagrand in 1994 [11] seems to provide the final word as far as universal bounds are concerned.  However, for fixed families of underlying probability distributions, the exponential rate in the deviation term can be fairly improved by the
