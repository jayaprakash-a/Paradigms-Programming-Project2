Object Recognition Using Spatiotemporal Signatures
 Abstract The sequence of images generated by motion between observer and object specifies a spatiotemporal signature for that object.  Evidence is presented that such spatiotemporal signatures are used in object recognition.  Subjects learned novel, three-dimensional, rotating objects from image sequences in a continuous recognition task.  During learning, the temporal order of images of a given object was constant.  During testing, the order of images in each sequence was reversed, relative to its order during learning.  This image sequence reversal produced significant reaction time increases and recognition rate decreases.  Results are interpreted in terms of object-specific spatiotemporal signatures.
