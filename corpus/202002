'Where was this taken?' Semi-supervised kernel based learning for location recognition
 Abstract In this report we compare the performance of various supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques on the problem of classifying incoming images according to their indoor or outdoor location, given a small set of training images taken at each location.  Recently nonlinear kernel based methods such as Support Vector Machines[6][7][8] have become very popular in visual pattern recognition.  There also has been recent work on transductive inference[1][7] which uses test data alongwith the training data to improve upon the performance.  The performance of various methods is evaluated against dierent sizes of the training data, keeping a fixed test data.  We compare inductive and transductive SVM's with dierent kernels, some simple parametric techniques and a few non-parametric kernel methods.  In particular we evaluate the extent to which semi-supervised learning methods can reduce the burden of labelling the training images by taking the test images into account.  The results show that SVMs outperform all other inductive techniques.  The semi-supervised transductive SVMs perform better than inductive SVMs for large enough data, but the performance falls when the training data is reduced to very low values(ref.  fig(6)).
