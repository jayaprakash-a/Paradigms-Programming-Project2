The Lumière Project: Bayesian User Modeling for Inferring the Goals and Needs of Software Users
 Abstract The Lumire Project centers on harnessing probability and utilitytoprovide assistance to computer software users.  We review work on Bayesian user models that can be employed to infer a user's needs by considering a user's background, actions, and queries.  Several problems were tackled in Lumire research, including (1) the construction of Bayesian models for reasoning about the time-varying goals of computer users from their observed actions and queries, (2) gaining access to a stream of events from software applications, (3) developing a language for transforming system events into observational variables represented in Bayesian user models, (4) developing persistent profiles to capture changes in a user's expertise, and (5) the developmentofanoverall architecture for an intelligentuserinterface.  Lumire prototypes served as the basis for the Office Assistant in the Microsoft Office '97 suite of productivity applications.
