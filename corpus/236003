Orientation rules for constructing Markov equivalence classes for maximal ancestral graphs
 Abstract It is well known that there may be many causal explanations that are consistent with a given set of data.  For processes that can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), many authors have characterized the common aspects of these explanations into one representation.  What is less well known is how the relationships common to every causal explanation among the observed variables of some DAG process change in the presence of latent variables.  Ancestral graphs provide a class of graphs that can encode conditional independence relations that arise in DAG models with latent and selection variables.  In this paper we present a set of orientation rules that construct the Markov equivalence class representative, given a member of the equivalence class.  These rules are sound and complete.  We also show that when the equivalence class includes a DAG, the equivalence class representative is the essential graph for the said DAG.
