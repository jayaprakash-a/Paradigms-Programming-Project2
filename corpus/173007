Inducing A Distance Metric From User Preferences For Clustering
 Abstract Traditional clustering algorithms cannot incorporate domain expert's preferences into the process of clustering.  Since one major goal of clustering is for the experts to gain insight into a dataset, it makes sense to allow experts to express opinions to guide clustering in some ways.  We propose a mechanism for the experts to express a small number of clustering preferences that they wish to be true.  We devise an algorithm which takes into account the expert constraints and guides the clustering towards them by inducing an appropriate distance metric, so that the final clustering maximally satisfies the expert preferences while is still reasonably good in traditional measures.
