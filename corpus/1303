Irregular Turbocodes
 Abstract Recently, several groups have increased the coding gain of iteratively decoded Gallager codes (low density parity check codes) by varying the number of parity check equations in which each codeword bit participates.  In regular turbocodes, each \systematic bit" participates in exactly 2 trellis sections.  We construct irregular turbocodes with systematic bits that participate in varying numbers of trellis sections.  These codes can be decoded by the iterative application of the sum-product algorithm (a low-complexity, more general form of the turbodecoding algorithm).  By making the original rate 1/2 turbocode of Berrou et al.  slightly irregular, we obtain a coding gain of 0. 15 dB at a block length of N = 131; 072, bringing the irregular turbocode within 0. 3 dB of capacity.  Just like regular turbocodes, irregular turbocodes are linear-time encodable.
