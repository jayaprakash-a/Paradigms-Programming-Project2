The Evolution of Learning: An Experiment in Genetic Connectionism
 This paper explores how an evolutionary process can produce systems that learn.  A general framework for the evolution of learning is outlined, and is applied to the task of evolving mechanisms suitable for supervised learning in single-layer neural networks.  Dynamic properties of a network's information-processing capacity are encoded genetically, and these properties are subjected to selective pressure based on their success in producing adaptive behavior in diverse environments.  As a result of selection and genetic recombination, various successful learning mechanisms evolve, including the well-known delta rule.  The effect of environmental diversity on the evolution of learning is investigated, and the role of different kinds of emergent phenomena in genetic and
