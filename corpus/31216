Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering for Dynamic Bayesian Networks
 Abstract Particle lters (PFs) are powerful samplingbased inference/learning algorithms for dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs).  They allow us to treat, in a principled way, any type of probability distribution, nonlinearity and non-stationarity.  They have appeared in several elds under such names as ^condensatio,^sequential Monte Carlo~ and ^survival of the ttest~.  In this paper, we show how we can exploit the structure of the DBN to increase the efciency of particle ltering, using a technique known as RaoBlackwellisation.  Essentially, this samples some of the variables, and marginalizes out the rest exactly, using the Kalman lter, HMM lter, junction tree algorithm, or any other nite dimensional optimal lter.  We show that RaoBlackwellised particle lters (RBPFs) lead to more accurate estimates than standard PFs.  We demonstrate RBPFs on two problems, namely non-stationary online regression with radial basis function networks and robot localization and map building.  We also discuss other potential application areas and provide references to some nite dimensional optimal lters.
