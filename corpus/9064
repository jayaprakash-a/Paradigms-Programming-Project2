An Overview of the SPRACH System for the Transcription of Broadcast News
 ABSTRACT This paper describes the SPRACH system developed for the 1998 Hub-4E broadcast news evaluation.  The system is based on the connectionist-HMM framework and uses both recurrent neural network and multi-layer perceptron acoustic models.  We describe both a system designed for the primary transcription hub, and a system for the less-than 10 times real-time spoke.  We then describe recent developments to CHRONOS, a time-first stack decoder.  We show how these developments have simplified the evaluation system, and led to significant reductions in the error rate of the 10x real-time system.  We also present a system designed to operate in real-time with negligible search error.
