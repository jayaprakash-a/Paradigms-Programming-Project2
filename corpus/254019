Using Prosodic Information to Constrain Language Models for Spoken Dialogue
 ABSTRACT We presentwork intended to improve speech recognition performance for computer dialogue by taking into account the way that dialogue context and intonational tune interact to limit the possibilities for what an utterance might be.  We report here on the extra constraintachieved in a bigram language model, expressed in terms of entropy,by using separate submodels for different sorts of dialogue acts, and trying to predict which submodel to apply by analysis of the intonation of the sentence being recognised.
