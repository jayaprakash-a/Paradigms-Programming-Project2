ANALOG VLSI SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK WITH ADDRESS DOMAIN PROBABILISTIC SYNAPSES
 ABSTRACT We present an analog VLSI address-event transceiver containing an array of integrate-and-fire neurons and a scheme for implementing a reconfigurable neural network with probabilistic synapses.  Neural "spikes" are transmitted through address-event representation---the address of the sending neuron is communicated through an asynchronous request and acknowledgment cycle.  Continuousvalued synaptic weights are implemented by probabilistically routing address events.  Results from a prototype system with 1,024 analog VLSI integrate-and-fire neurons, each with up to 128 probabilistic synapses, demonstrate these concepts in an image processing application.
