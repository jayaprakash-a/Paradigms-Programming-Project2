Depth-dependent contrast gain-control
 Abstract Contrast adaptation that was limited to a small region of the peripheral retina was induced as observers viewed a multiple depthplane textured surface.  The small region undergoing contrast adaptation was present only in one depth-plane to determine whether contrast gain-control is depth-dependent.  After adaptation, observers performed a contrast-matching task in both the adapted and a non-adapted depth-plane to measure the magnitude and spatial specificity of contrast adaptation.  Results indicated that contrast adaptation was depth-dependent under full-cue (disparity, linear perspective, texture gradient) conditions; there was a highly significant change in contrast gain in the depth-plane of adaptation and no significant gain change in the unadapted depth-plane.  A second experiment showed that under some monocular viewing conditions a similar change in contrast gain was present in the adapted depth-plane despite the absence of disparity information for depth.  Two control experiments with no-depth displays showed that contrast adaptation can also be texture- and location-dependent, but the magnitude of these e. ects was significantly smaller than the depth-dependent e. ect.  These results demonstrate that mechanisms of contrast adaptation are conditioned by 3-D and 2-D viewing contexts.
