THE ROLE OF INTEGRAL FEATURES FOR PERCEIVING IMAGE DISTORTION
 Number of manuscript pages: 30 Number of figures: 6 Number of tables: 4 Abstract The computational model we propose deals with the measurement of image distortion in such a way that the comparison of a pair of images is performed by matching the corresponding integral features registered within the same fixation point which a spatial sensitivity function directs about the images.  An integral feature refers to the resultant of recombining the separable representations (color, form, brightness, etc) at stimulus locations with focal attention.  The computation of a spatial sensitivity function determines the stimulus locations in the original image.  These locations are processed serially in order to measure distortion between the corresponding conjunction of features in the image pair.
