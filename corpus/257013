 The Bas-Relief Ambiguity.  Abstract Since antiquity, artisans have created flattenedforms, often called "bas-reliefs," which give an exaggerated perception of depth when viewedfrom a particular vantage point.  This paper presents an explanation of this phenomena, showing that the ambiguity in determining the relief of an object is not confined to bas-relief sculpture but is implicit in the determination of the structure of any object.
