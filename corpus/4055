Memoryless policies: theoretical limitations and practical results
 Abstract One form of adaptive behavior is "goal-seeking" in which an agent acts so as to minimize the time it takes to reach a goal state.  This paper presents some theoretical and empirical findings on algorithms that devise goal-seeking behaviors for ``memoryless" agents who base their behavioral decisions solely on current sensations.  The basic results are that (1) the general problem of finding good deterministic memoryless policies is intractable, however, (2) simple branch-and-bound heuristics can be used to find optimal memoryless policies extremely quickly for some established example environments.
