A Probabilistic Exclusion Principle for Tracking Multiple Objects
 Abstract Tracking multiple targets whose models are indistinguishable is a challenging problem.  Simply instantiating several independent 1-body trackers is not an adequate solution, because the independent trackers can coalesce onto the best-fitting target.  This paper presents an observation density for tracking which solves this problem by exhibiting a probabilistic exclusion principle.  Exclusion arises naturally from a systematic derivation of the observation density, without relying on heuristics.  Another important contribution of the paper is the presentation of partitioned sampling, a new sampling method for multiple object tracking.  Partitioned sampling avoids the high computational load associated with fully coupled trackers, while retaining the desirable properties of coupling.
