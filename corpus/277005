Computer Vision for Interactive Computer Graphics
 Abstract Computers looking through a camera at people is a potentially powerful technique to facilitate human-computer interaction.  The computer can interpret the user's movements, gestures, and glances.  Fundamental visual algorithms include tracking, shape recognition, and motion analysis.  For interactive graphics applications, these algorithms need to be robust, fast, and run on inexpensive hardware.  Fortunately, the interactive applications also make the vision problems easier: they constrain the possible visual interpretations and provide helpful visual feedback to the user.  Thus, some fast and simple vision algorithms can fit well with interactive graphics applications.  We describe several vision algorithms for interactive graphics, and present various vision controlled graphics applications whichwehave built which use them: vision-based computer games, a hand signal recognition system, and a television set controlled by hand gestures.  Some of these applications can employ a special artificial retina chip for image detection or pre-processing.
