A COMPARISON OF MODELS OF VISUAL CORTICAL MAP FORMATION
 ABSTRACT Several classes of models of visual cortical map characterization and development are compared.  Characteristics and predictions of the models are compared to one another and to cortical maps observed in animals.  Several models are found to predict incorrect map structure.  Certain observed patterns of visual maps imply constraints on the processes which could be involved in their morphogenesis.  1 FEATURE MAPS IN VISUAL CORTEX Individual cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex, or striate cortex, respond differently to features in visual input, with feature preferences determined in part by the pattern of connection between retinal light receptors and cortex.  Striate cortical receptive fields, descriptions of features to which each cell responds, are often localized in the visual field, may be dominated by input from either eye, and usually show a preference for stimuli with a particular orientation.  Several receptive field properties of neurons are arranged in the cortex in a complicated two-dimensional map such that nearby columns of neurons tend to have similar receptive fields.  Due to the ordered projections from the eyes, a roughly topographic map of visual space is formed on the cortical surface.  An optical imaging technique [1, 2, 4] reveals the embedded maps of ocular dominance and orientation preference over small patches of the cortex.  The details of the cortical maps vary greatly between individual animals, but certain organizing principles appear invariant.  Depending on the species, ocular 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.
