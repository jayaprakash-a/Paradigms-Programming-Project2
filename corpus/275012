Acquisition and Extinction in Autoshaping
 Abstract Gallistel and Gibbon (2000) have presented quantitative data on the speed with which animals acquire behavioral responses during autoshaping, together with a statistical model of learning intended to account for them.  Although this model captures the form of the dependencies amongst critical variables, its detailed predictions are substantially at variance with the data.  In the present article, further key data on the speed of acquisition are used to motivate an alternative model of learning, in which animals can be interpreted as paying different amounts of attention to stimuli according to estimates of their differential reliabilities as predictors.
