SAR for Agriculture and Forestry (SAFE) : Technical Requirements
 ABSTRACT A summary of a study on the use of spaceborne SAR for forestry and agriculture in Europe is given.  User requirements were surveyed, then translated into physical parameters which may potentially be inferred from measurements by an appropriate instrument.  The performance of SAR in estimating the required parameters was then assessed from the literature.  Overall performance assessments are given, and system options are suggested.  We also consider the methodology, limitations and accomplishments of the study.
