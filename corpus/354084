Constant Interaction-Time Scatter/Gather Browsing of Very Large Document Collections
 Abstract The Scatter/Gather document browsing method uses fast document clustering to produce table-of-contentslike outlines of large document collections.  Previous work [1] developed linear-time document clustering algorithms to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collections.  However, even linear-time algorithms are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collections such as Tipster, the DARPA standard text retrieval evaluation collection.  We present a scheme that supports constant interaction-time Scatter/Gather of arbitrarily large collections after nearlinear time preprocessing.  This involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy.  A modification of Scatter/Gather employing this scheme, and an example of its use over the Tipster collection are presented.  1 Background Our previous work on Scatter/Gather [1] has shown that document clustering can be used as a first-class tool for browsing large text collections.  Browsing is distinguished from search because it is query-free.  We posit situations in which the user has an information need that is either too general or too vague to be usefully expressed as a query is some search language.  For example, the user may not be familiar with the vocabulary appropriate for describing a topic of interest, or may not wish to commit himself to a particular choice of words.  Indeed, the user may not be looking for anything specific at all, but rather may wish to explore the general
