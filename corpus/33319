Classification of Articulatory and Acoustic Patterns of Speech in the Task Spaces
 Abstract The performance of automatic speech recognition is limited at present by the large variability encountered in speech.  A potential area of research for improving the performance of automatic speech recognition is the articulatory representation of speech.  This involves the study of some articulatory invariant features of speech patterns which could be detected from speech acoustics.  Besides automatic speech recognition, the articulatory representations of speech could also have applications in speech synthesis, speech coding and training deaf people to speak.  This paper presents some preliminary results of our research in the fields of articulatory representation of speech and classification of articulatory and acoustic patterns of speech in some spaces called task spaces.  These task spaces are phoneme specific and are defined as some subspaces of the original articulatory and acoustic spaces in which the patterns are maximally concentrated.
