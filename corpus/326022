On Learning Unions of Pattern Languages and Tree Patterns
 Abstract.  In this paper, we present efficient on-line algorithms for learning unions of a constant number of tree patterns, unions of a constant number of one-variable pattern languages, and unions of a constant number of pattern languages with fixed length substitutions.  Since we use a reduction to Winnow, our algorithms are robust against attribute noise.  By fixed length substitutions we mean that each variable x i must be substituted by terminal strings of constant length l(x i ).  Note that the length of the substitutions can be different for different variables (i. e.  it is not required that l(x i ) = l(x j )).  The approach we used is quite general and may be applicable to learning other pattern related concept classes.  For example, we could learn a more general pattern language class in which a penalty (i. e.  weight) is assigned to each violation of the rule that a terminal symbol cannot be changed or that a pair of variable symbols, of the same variable, must be substituted by the same terminal string.  An instance is positive if and only if the penalty incurred for violating these rules is below a given tolerable threshold.  We also show that if an arbitrary unions of pattern languages with fixed length substitutions can be learned efficiently then DNFs are efficiently learnable in the mistake bound model.
