Strategy Learning with Multilayer Connectionist Representations
 Abstract Results are presented that demonstrate the learning and fine-tuning of search strategies using connectionist mechanisms.  Previous studies of strategy learning within the symbolic, production-rule formalism have not addressed fine-tuning behavior.  Here a two-layer connectionist system is presented that develops its search from aweak to a task-specific strategy and #ne-tunes its performance.  The system is applied to a simulated, realtime, balance-control task.  We compare the performance of one-layer and two-layer networks, showing that the ability of the two-layer network to discover new features and thus enhance the original representation is critical to solving the balancing task.
