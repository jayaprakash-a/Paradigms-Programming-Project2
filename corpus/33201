Semi-supervised Learning by Entropy Minimization
 Abstract We consider the semi-supervised learning problem, where a decision rule is to be learned from labeled and unlabeled data.  In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning.  Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases.  A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solutions benefit from unlabeled data.  The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model.  The performances are definitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspecified, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the "cluster assumption".  Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces.
