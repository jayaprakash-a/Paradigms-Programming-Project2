Video Synthesis made simple with the X-Slits Projection
 Abstract We propose novel algorithms for image based rendering (IBR) by simulating a new family of scene-to-image projections, the Crossed-Slits (X-Slits) projections.  New X-Slits images can be easily generated from a sequence of images captured by a translating pinhole camera, and those images look compelling and realistic.  We show how this can be used for rendering movies of virtual walkthroughs by a very fast and simple mosaicing algorithm, providing a strong 3-D sensation of parallax and occlusions, as well as specularity and transparency.
