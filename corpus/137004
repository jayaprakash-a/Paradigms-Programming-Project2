Support Vector Machines and Kernel Fisher Discriminants: A Case Study using Electronic Nose Data
 ABSTRACT Kernel methods provide a promising new family of algorithms for machine learning and data mining applications.  In particular, kernel-based nonlinear classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) and kernel fisher discriminants (KFDs) have been found to work well in practical problems.  In addition, there are methods for training these algorithms on large-scale data sets making them very suitable for use in data mining.  In this paper, we evaluate the performance of SVMs and KFDs on a dataset generated with a conducting polymer composite-based electronic nose.  The ability of SVM and KFD classifiers to correctly identify the functional class (category) of a chemical based on its electronic nose signature is evaluated and compared against other more traditional methods, including nearest neighbors and linear Fisher discriminants.  Tradeoffs between the different kernel methods and performance relative to more traditional methods are discussed.
