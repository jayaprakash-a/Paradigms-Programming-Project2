Just-in-Time Requirements Analysis -- The Engine that Drives the Planning Game
 Abstract Just-in-Time Requirements Analysis is an alternative approach to analysis that perfectly compliments XP development and planning.  Rather than analyzing and defining requirements up front, Just-in-Time Requirements Analysis defines requirements only when they are needed -- and only at the detailed required.  It is an iterative process that expects and embraces change and makes it easy for requirements to evolve over time.  This paper details the concepts behind Just-in-Time Requirements Analysis (JITRA) and identifies the benefits of using JITRA on XP Projects.  It outlines how JITRA is implemented in XP development and shows how JITRA fits into XP planning.
