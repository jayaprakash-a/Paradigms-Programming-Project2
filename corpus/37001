Identification of Behaviors in an Agent's Phase Space
 Abstract: This paper describes a method for analyzing the behavior of an autonomous robot.  The robot is viewed as a continuous, stochastic dynamical system.  The analysis starts from an empirical phase portrait.  In a first stage, elementary regularities are detected.  These regularities, called transient attractors, combine properties of attractors with properties of partition cells of phase space.  As the system trajectory passes through these regularities repeatedly, a sequence of identifiable events is produced, which can be interpreted as a symbol sequence.  This sequence is further analyzed in the second stage, where a finite description of temporal regularities within it is constructed.  This description comes in the format of a variety of finite-state automata.  In a third stage, higher-order regularities in this #nite-state-like description are identified.  This yields a hierarchic behavior model.  At all stages, regularities are defined using criteria of maximal local predictability.  Thus, the entire method can be seen as an information theoretic approachto bridging the gap between the non-symbolic, quantitative level of robots and higher-level symbolic models.
