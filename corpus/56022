From Instance-level Constraints to Space-Level Constraints: Making the Most of Prior Knowledge in Data Clustering
 Abstract We present an improved method for clustering in the presence of very limited supervisory information, given as pairwise instance constraints.  By allowing instance-level constraints to have spacelevel inductive implications, we are able to successfully incorporate constraints for a wide range of data set types.  Our method greatly improves on the previously studied constrained -means algorithm, generally requiring less than half as many constraints to achieve a given accuracy on a range of real-world data, while also being more robust when over-constrained.  We additionally discuss an active learning algorithm which increases the value of constraints even further.
