Fractional Belief Propagation
 Abstract We consider approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models with approximate free energy methods.  By considering equivalent factor-graph representations of a probabilistic model, we write down a family of different approximate tree-like free energies.  We show that this family interpolates between the naive mean-field free energy and the Bethe free energy.  We derive fixed-point equations that lead to fractional belief propagation algorithms, which include standard mean-field equations and loopy belief propagation as special cases.  Using a cavity-#eld argument, we compute the fractional algorithm that gives, in lowest order, a correction around the Bethe (loopy belief) approximation for the means.  Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.
