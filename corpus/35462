Byzantine Modification Detection in Multicast Networks using Randomized Network Coding
 Abstract--- Distributed randomized network coding is a flexible and robust approach to transmitting and compressing information in multi-source multicast networks.  In this paper, we show how the path diversity and distributed randomness of this approach can be exploited to provide for Byzantine modification detection.  This is achieved by incorporating a simple polynomial hash value into each packet, which adds minimal computational and communication overhead.  The effectiveness of our scheme relies only on a Byzantine attacker being unable to design and supply modified packets with complete knowledge of other packets received by other nodes.  The detection probability can be traded off against the overhead (i. e. , the ratio of hash bits to data bits) -- the detection probability increases with the overhead, as well as with the number of unmodified packets obtained at the receiver whose contents are unknown to the attacker.
