Practical Filtering for Stochastic Volatility Models
 This paper provides a simulation-based approach to filtering and sequential parameter learning for stochastic volatility models.  We develop a fast simulationbased approach using the practical filter of Polson, Stroud and Muller (2002).  We compare our approach to sequential parameter learning and filtering with an auxiliary particle filtering algorithm based on Storvik (2002).  For simulated data, there is close agreement between the two methods.  For data on the S&P 500 market stock index from 1984{1990, our algorithm agrees closely with a full MCMC analysis, whereas the auxiliary particle filter degenerates.
