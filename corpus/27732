Constructing Free Energy Approximations and Generalized Belief Propagation Algorithms
 Abstract Important inference problems in statistical physics, computer vision, error-correcting coding theory, and artificial intelligence can all be reformulated as the computation of marginal probabilities on factor graphs.  The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles.  We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation to the free energy for a factor graph.  We explain how to obtain regionbased free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms.  We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a "valid" approximation.  We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the "Bethe method," the "junction graph method," the "cluster variation method," and the "region graph method. " The region graph method is the most general of these methods, and it subsumes all the other methods.  Region graphs also provide the natural graphical setting for GBP algorithms.  We explain how to obtain three different versions of GBP algorithms and show that their fixed points will always correspond to stationary points of the region graph approximation to the free energy.  We also show that the region graph approximation is exact when the region graph has no cycles.
