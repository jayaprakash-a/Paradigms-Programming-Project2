Logistic regression for partial labels
 Abstract This paper discusses learning from partially labeled data in the framework of probabilistic supervised classi#cation.  Minimum commitment logistic regression is a conservative solution to the problem of imprecise labels, which should be appropriate if the faithful estimation of posterior probabilities is an issue.  Semi-supervised learning is among the problems considered, and a series of experiments shows that our second proposal, self-consistent logistic regression is a serious contender to more classical solutions involving generative models.
