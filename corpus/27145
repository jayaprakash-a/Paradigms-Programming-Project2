Efficient clustering of high-dimensional data sets with application to reference matching
 ABSTRACT Many important problems involve clustering large datasets.  Although naive implementations of clustering are computationally expensive, there are established ecient techniques for clustering when the dataset has either (1) a limited number of clusters, (2) a low feature dimensionality, or (3) a small number of data points.  However, there has been much less work on methods of eciently clustering datasets that are large in all three ways at once
