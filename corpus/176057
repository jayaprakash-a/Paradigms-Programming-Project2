Relationship between gradient and EM steps in latent variable models
 Abstract We present a close relationship between Expectation - Maximization algorithm and direct optimization approaches such as gradient-based methods for parameter learning.  We show that the step EM takes in the parameter space and true gradient are related by the symmetric positive definite P matrix, and provide an explicit form of this matrix for several widely used latent variable models.  We then go on deriving a general form of the P matrix for the regular exponential family in terms of its natural parameters.
