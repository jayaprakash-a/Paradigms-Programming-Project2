Learning to Reason with a Restricted View \Lambda
 Abstract The Learning to Reason framework combines the study of Learning and Reasoning into a single task.  Within it, learning is done specifically for the purpose of reasoning with the learned knowledge.  Computational considerations show that this is a useful paradigm; in some cases learning and reasoning problems that are intractable when studied separately become tractable when performed as a task of Learning to Reason.  In this paper we study Learning to Reason problems where the interaction with the world supplies the learner only partial information in the form of partial assignments.  Several natural interpretations of partial assignments are considered and learning and reasoning algorithms using these are developed.  The results presented exhibit a tradeoff between learnability, the strength of the oracles used in the interface, and the range of reasoning queries the learner is guaranteed to answer correctly.
