Cooperative Multi-Sensor Video Surveillance
 Abstract Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the David Sarnoff Research Center (Sarnoff) have begun a joint, integrated feasibility demonstration in the area of Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM).  The objective is to develop a cooperative, multi-sensor video surveillance system that provides continuous coverage over large battlefield areas.  Image Understanding (IU) technologies will be developed to: 1) coordinate multiple sensors to seamlessly track moving targets over an extended area, 2) actively control sensor and platform parameters to track multiple moving targets, 3) integrate multisensor output with collateral data to maintain an evolving, scene-level representation of all targets and platforms, and 4) monitor the scene for unusual "trigger" events and activities.  These technologies will be integrated into an experimental testbed to support evaluation, data collection, and demonstration of other VSAM technologies developed within the DARPA IU community.
