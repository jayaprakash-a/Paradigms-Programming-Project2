NON-LINEAR SPEECH TRANSITION VISUALIZATION
 ABSTRACT Modelling context effects and segmental transitions in speech recognition systems is very important.  Explicitly modelling segmental transitions in a RNN framework would circumvent these problems.  We present an interesting application of Principal Curves, an algorithm to extract a non-linear summary of p-dimensional data firstly published in 1989 by Hastie/Stuetzle.  The algorithm can be used to visualize non-linear transient characteristics in speech.  We will show that between-phone characteristics found within diphones can be used as discriminant information to distinguish ambiguous phones.  The technique used is explained and illustrated on the examples /bah/, /dah/ and /gah/.
