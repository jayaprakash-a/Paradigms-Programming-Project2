Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Multiscale Problems Micro-macro transition for the atomic chain via Whitham's modulation equation
 Abstract The subject matter of this paper is the thermodynamic description of the nonlinear atomic chain with temperature.  For this reason we consider special approximate solutions of Newton's equations, in which the atoms perform microscopic oscillations in form of modulated traveling waves.  We start with an existence result for periodic traveling wave with arbitrary large amplitudes, and study several examples including the harmonic chain, the hard sphere model, and the small-amplitude approximation.  Then we discuss the thermodynamic properties of traveling waves,
