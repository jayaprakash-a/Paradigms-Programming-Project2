Spike sorting in the frequency domain with overlap detection
 Abstract This paper deals with the problem of extracting the activity of individual neurons from multi-electrode recordings.  Important aspects of this work are: 1) the sorting is done in two stages - a statistical model of the spikes from different cells is built and only then are occurrences of these spikes in the data detected by scanning through the original data, 2) the spike sorting is done in the frequency domain, 3) strict statistical tests are applied to determine if and how a spike should be classified, 4) the statistical model for detecting overlaping spike events is proposed, 5) slow dynamics of spike shapes are tracked during long experiments.  Results from the application of these techniques to data collected from the escape response system of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, are presented.
