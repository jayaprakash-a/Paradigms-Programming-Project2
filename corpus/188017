Pointing without a pointer
 ABSTRACT We present a method for performing selection tasks based on continuous control of multiple, competing agents who try to determine the user's intentions from their control behaviour without requiring an explicit pointer.  The entropy in the selection process decreases in a continuous fashion -- we provide experimental evidence of selection from 500 initial targets.  The approach allows adaptation over time to best make use of the multimodal communication channel between the human and the system.  This general approach is well suited to mobile and wearable applications, shared displays and security conscious settings.
