Timing, Clocks, and Dynamical Systems
 Theoretical and experimental issues for our understanding of the timing of motor acts are reviewed, contrasting stochastic and dynamic timing models.  It is argued that the theory of dynamical systems and, in particular, of limit cycle attractors, provides a unified framework within which these issues can be appreciated.  The strength of stochastic timing models in the domain of absolute timing is contrasted with the strength of dynamic timing models in the domain of relative timing, the unification of the two domains being currently under way.  It is further argued that accounts of timing must examine the interrelation between timing and other levels of processing involved in movement generation, in particular, the representation of spatial aspects of movement and the control of movement.  The emergence of discrete event structure in timing skills is discussed from a dynamical systems perspective.  Finally, the understanding of the timing structure of discrete movement is raised as a further challenge for future work.
