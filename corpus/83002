Large-Scale Prediction of Disulphide Bond Connectivity
 Abstract The formation of disulphide bridges among cysteines is an important feature of protein structures.  Here we develop new methods for the prediction of disulphide bond connectivity.  We first build a large curated data set of proteins containing disulphide
