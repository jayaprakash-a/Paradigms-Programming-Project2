Statically Finding Errors in Spreadsheets
 Abstract We describe a methodology for detecting user errors in spreadsheets, using the notion of units as our basic elements of checking.  We define the concept of a header and discuss two types of relationships between headers, namely is-a and has-a relationships.  With these, we develop a set of rules to assign units to cells in the spreadsheet.  We check for errors by ensuring that every cell has a well-formed unit.  We describe an implementation of the system that allows the user to check Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.
