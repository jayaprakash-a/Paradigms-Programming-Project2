INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS FOR BINARY DATA: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
 ABSTRACT We consider a mixing model where independent binary components are mixed using binary OR operations.  Using extensive simulations, we investigate whether the model can be estimated using ordinary cumulant-based ICA algorithms.  We show that the model can indeed be estimated if the data is sparse enough.  We also compare the 3rd and 4th order cumulants.  In the no-noise and low-noise cases, the 3rd order cumulant performs better, but in the presence of strong noise, the 4th-order cumulant, somewhat surprisingly, performs better for very sparse data.
