Evolution of a Low-Distortion, Low-Bias 60 Decibel Op Amp with Good Frequency Generalization using Genetic Programming
 ABSTRACT Genetic programming was used to evolve both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) for each component of a low-distortion, low-bias 60 decibel (1000to-1) amplifier circuit with good frequency generalization.  The evolved circuit was composed of two types of transistors (active elements) as well as resistors and capacitors.
