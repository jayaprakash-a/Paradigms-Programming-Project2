Rapid development of Hindi named entity recognition using conditional random fields and feature induction
 This paper describes our application of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with feature induction to a Hindi named entity recognition task.  With only five days development time and little knowledge of this language, we automatically discover relevant features by providing a large array of lexical tests and using feature induction to automatically construct the features that most increase conditional likelihood.  In an effort to reduce overfitting, we use a combination of a Gaussian prior and early-stopping based on the results of 10-fold cross validation.
