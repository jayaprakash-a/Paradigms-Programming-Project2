Quadratic Maps with Convex Images
 Abstract.  Seeking exactness for "convex relaxation", we define a map f : ! n ! ! m to be ICON if its image f(! n ) is convex.  Analogously, f is termed LICON(AICON) if its image of every linear (every affine) subspace is convex.  This paper investigates the characterization of quadratic maps of these three types, and the complexity of recognizing them.  We give a characterization of quadratic ICON maps, and use it to show that ICON-map recognition is NP-Hard.  Then we develop a polynomial time algorithm for identifying quadratic LICON maps.  A characterization of quadratic AICON maps is established, that lends itself to an easy recognition algorithm.
