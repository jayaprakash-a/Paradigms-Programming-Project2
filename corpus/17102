Topic Identification in Dynamical Text by Complexity Pursuit
 Abstract.  The problem of analysing dynamically evolving textual data has arisen within the last few years.  An example of such data is the discussion appearing in Internet chat lines.  In this Letter a recently introduced source separation method,termed as complexity pursuit, is applied to the problem of finding topics in dynamical text and is compared against several blind separation algorithms for the problem considered.  Complexity pursuit is a generalisation of projection pursuit to time series and it is able to use both higher-order statistical measures and temporal dependency information in separating the topics.
