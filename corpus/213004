Cell Assemblies, Associative Memory and Temporal Structure in Brain Signals \Lambda
 Abstract: In this work we discuss Hebb's old ideas about cell assemblies in the light of recent results concerning temporal structure and correlations in neural signals.  We want to give a conceptual, necessarily only rough picture, how ideas about `binding by synchronisation', `synfire chains', `local and global assemblies', `short and long term memory' and `behaviour' might be integrated into a coherent model of brain functioning based on neuronal assemblies.
