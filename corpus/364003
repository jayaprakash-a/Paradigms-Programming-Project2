Dynamic Abstraction Networks
 Abstract We propose dynamic abstraction networks, a new type of hierarchical graphical model that combines state and temporal abstraction.  Fundamental to our approach is the belief that temporal abstraction and state abstraction are intertwined, and should be modeled jointly in the same network.  For the state abstraction component of the model we use the hierarchical hidden Markov model, while for the policy abstraction component we use a structure based on the abstract hidden Markov model.  We present results on both real and synthetic activity data comparing the policy abstractions learned with and without the use of state abstraction.
