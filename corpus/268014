CuBICA: Independent Component Analysis by Simultaneous Third- and Fourth-Order Cumulant Diagonalization
 Abstract--- CuBICA, an improved method for independent component analysis (ICA) based on the diagonalization of cumulant tensors is proposed.  It is based on Comon's algorithm [1] but it takes third- and fourth-order cumulant tensors into account simultaneously.  The underlying contrast function is also mathematically much simpler and has a more intuitive interpretation.  It is therefore easier to optimize and approximate.  A comparison with Comon's and three other ICA-algorithms on different data sets demonstrates its performance.
