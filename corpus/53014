Real-Time Phase-Based Stereo for a Mobile Robot
 Abstract The performance of a mobile robot crucially depends on the accuracy, duration and reliability of its sensor interpretation.  A major source of information are CCD-cameras which provide a detailed view of the robot's environment.  This paper presents a real-time stereo algorithm implemented on the mobile robot RHINO of the University of Bonn.  The algorithm exploit the phases of wavelet-f iltered image pairs to localize edges and to estimate their disparities with subpixel accuracy.  The disparities are computed by an initial search for corresponding points within a given interval and a subsequent measurement of phasedif ferences.  The real-time constraints of autonomous object detection and navigation are fulf illed by partially implementing the stereo algorithm on a pipeline computer Datacube.  Experimental results on real world scenes under real world conditions demonstrate the stereo algorithm's robustness and suitability for autonomous robot applications.
