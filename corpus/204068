Performance of TCP over Different Routing Protocols in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks
 Abstract---TCP/IP is the standard networking protocol on the internet and is also the most widely used.  Due to these reasons, its use over Mobile Ad-Hoc networks is a certainty.  Ad-Hoc networks are prone to link failures due to mobility.  TCP is unable to distinguish between losses due to route failures and losses due to congestion.  As a result, throughput degrades significantly when nodes move.  It is therefore essential to study how TCP performs over ad-hoc networks.  We have used simulations in the cmu extension to ns to analyse the performance of TCP Tahoe over a set of routing protocols including the Signal Stability Adaptive routing protocol which we have implemented in ns-2.  We identify characteristics in each of these routing protocols that determine the behaviour of TCP over them.
