A Note on the Decomposition Methods for Support Vector Regression
 Abstract The dual formulation of support vector regression involves with two closely related sets of variables.  When the decomposition method is used, many existing approaches use pairs of indices from these two sets as the working set.  Basically they select a base set first and then expand it so all indices are pairs.  This makes the implementation different from that for support vector classification.  In addition, a larger optimization sub-problem has to be solved in each iteration.  In this paper we provide theoretical proofs and conduct experiments to show that directly using the base set as the working set leads to similar convergence (number of iterations).  Therefore, by using a smaller working set while keeping similar number of iterations, the program can be simpler and more ecient.
