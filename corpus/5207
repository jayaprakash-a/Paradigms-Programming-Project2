Centrifugal bias for second-order but not first-order motion
 Limited-lifetime Gabor stimuli were used to assess both first- and second-order motion in peripheral vision.  Both first- and second-order motion mechanisms were present at a 20-deg eccentricity.  Second-order motion, unlike first-order, exhibits a bias for centrifugal motion, suggesting a role for the second-order mechanism in optic flow processing.  2001 Optical Society of America OCIS codes:
