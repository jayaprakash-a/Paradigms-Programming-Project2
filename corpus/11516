OFF-LINE CURSIVE SCRIPT WORD RECOGNITION -A SURVEY
 Abstract We review the field of off-line cursive word recognition.  We mainly deal with the various methods that were proposed to realize the core of recognition in a word recognition system.  These methods are discussed in view of the two most important properties of such a system: the size and nature of the lexicon involved, and whether or not a segmentation stage is present.  We classify the field to three categories.  Segmentationfree methods, which compare a sequence of observations derived from a word image with similar references of words in the lexicon.  Segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word.  Perception-oriented approach, that relates to methods that perform a human-like reading technique, in which anchor features found all-over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase.
