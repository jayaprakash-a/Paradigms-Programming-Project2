p-Subsequentiable Transducers
 Abstract.  p-subsequential transducers are ecient finite-state transducers with p final outputs used in a variety of applications.  Not all transducers admit equivalent p-subsequential transducers however.  We briefly describe an existing generalized determinization algorithm for psubsequential transducers and give the first characterization of p-subsequentiable transducers, transducers that admit equivalent p-subsequential transducers.  Our characterization shows the existence of an ecient algorithm for testing p-subsequentiability.  We have fully implemented the generalized determinization algorithm and the algorithm for testing psubsequentiability.  We report experimental results showing that these algorithms are practical in large-vocabulary speech recognition applications.  The theoretical formulation of our results is the equivalence of the following three properties for finite-state transducers: determinizability in the sense of the generalized algorithm, p-subsequentiability, and the twins property.
