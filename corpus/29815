Example-Based Facial Sketch Generation with Non-parametric Sampling
 Abstract In this paper, we present an example-based facial sketch system.  Our system automatically generates a sketch from an input image, by learning from example sketches drawn with a particular style by an artist.  There are two key elements in our system: a non-parametric sampling method and a flexible sketch model.  Given an input image pixel and its neighborhood, the conditional distribution of a sketch point is computed by querying the examples and finding all similar neighborhoods.  An "expected sketch image" is then drawn from the distribution to reflect the drawing style.  Finally, facial sketches are obtained by incorporating the sketch model.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques.
