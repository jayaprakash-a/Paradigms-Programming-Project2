Clustering Irregular Shapes Using High-Order Neurons
 This article introduces a method for clustering irregularly shaped data arrangements using high-order neurons.  Complex analytical shapes are modeled by replacing the classic synaptic weight of the neuron by highorder tensors in homogeneous coordinates.  In the rst- and second-order cases, this neuron corresponds to a classic neuron and to an ellipsoidalmetric neuron.  We show how high-order shapes can be formulated to follow the maximum-correlation activation principle and permit simple local Hebbian learning.  We also demonstrate decomposition of spatial arrangements of data clusters, including very close and partially overlapping clusters, which are dif cult to distinguish using classic neurons.  Superior results are obtained for the Iris data.
