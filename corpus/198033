Comovement of International Financial Markets Loran Chollete, Victor de la Pe~ na, and Ching-
 Abstract Do developed and emerging markets move together more in downturns than in upturns? In order to address this question we estimate the structure of dependence in international stock markets, using various parametric copulas.  Moreover, we nest symmetric and asymmetric dependence using a novel mixture model approach.  Our two most significant findings are as follows.  First, for G5 countries, asymmetric dependence dominates the model.  Second, and more surprisingly, for Latin American and Asian countries, there is mixed evidence on asymmetry of dependence.  In sum, our results suggest the interesting possibility that developed and developing economies differ in their exposure to downside risk, with developing economies having potentially less downside risk.
