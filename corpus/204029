Scaling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms by Learning Variable Temporal Resolution Models
 Abstract The close connection between reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms has fueled research on RL within the machine learning community.  Yet, despite increased theoretical understanding, RL algorithms remain applicable to simple tasks only.  In this paper I use the abstract framework afforded by the connection to dynamic programming to discuss the scaling issues faced by RL researchers.  I focus on learning agents that have to learn to solve multiple structured RL tasks in the same environment.  I propose learning abstract environment models where the abstract actions represent "intentions" of achieving a particular state.  Such models are variable temporal resolution models because in different parts of the state space the abstract actions span different number of time steps.  The operational definitions of abstract actions can be learned incrementally using repeated experience at solving RL tasks.  I prove that under certain conditions solutions to new RL tasks can be found by using simulated experience with abstract actions alone.
