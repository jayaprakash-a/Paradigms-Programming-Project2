Gaussian process classification for segmenting and annotating sequences
 Abstract Multiclass classification refers to the problem of assigning labels to instances where labels belong to some finite set of elements.  Often, however, the instances to be labeled do not occur in isolation, but rather in observation sequences.  One is then interested in predicting the joint label configuration, i. e.  the sequence of labels, using models that take possible interdependencies between label variables into account.  This scenario subsumes problems of sequence segmentation and annotation.  In this paper, we investigate the use of Gaussian Process (GP) classification for label sequences.
