Shape and Spatially-Varying BRDFs From Photometric Stereo
 Figure 1: From (a) 10 photographs of an object taken under varying illumination, we can reconstruct (b) its normals and materials, represented as (c) a material weight map controlling a mixture of (d,e) fundamental materials.  Using this representation we can (f) rerender the object under novel lighting.  Abstract We describe a suite of techniques for extracting shape and materials from multiple photographs of an object captured from the same viewpoint but with differing illumination.  Our method extracts perpixel BRDFs along with 3D shape, under an assumption that the materials can be described as a convex combination of a small number of fundamental materials.  We also show examples of interactive lighting and editing operations made possible by our methods, including direct manipulation of material coefficients and material transfer between models.
