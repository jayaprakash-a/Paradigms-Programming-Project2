Exceptionally directional sources with photonic-bandgap crystals
 Three-dimensional photonic-bandgap crystals are used to design and fabricate uniquely directional sources and receivers.  By utilizing the resonances of a Fabry--Perot cavity formed with photonic-bandgap crystals, we were able to create exceptionally directional sources by placing the sources within such a cavity.  Very good agreement between finite-difference time-domain calculations and the experiment is obtained.  Radiation patterns with half-power beam widths of less than 12 degrees were obtained.  2001 Optical Society of America
