An Integrated, Conditional Model of Information Extraction and Coreference with Application to Citation Matching
 Abstract Although information extraction and coreference resolution appear together in many applications, most current systems perform them as independent steps.  This paper describes an approach to integrated inference for extraction and coreference based on conditionally-trained undirected graphical models.  We discuss the advantages of conditional probability training, and of a coreference model structure based on graph partitioning.  On a data set of research paper citations, we show significant reduction in error by using extraction uncertainty to improve coreference citation matching accuracy, and using coreference to improve the accuracy of the extracted fields.
