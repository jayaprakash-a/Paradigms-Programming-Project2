Stable orientation tuning in the visual cortex
 Abstract We study the behaviour of the Ben-Yishai hypercolumn model [2] under presentation of oriented stimuli, having extended this model by including plastic afferent (LGN to cortex) connections.  We find that Hebbian plasticity creates a self-organising map and show that constraining or modifying the standard Hebb rule in a particular way will lead to a contrast-insensitive tuning width, thus giving an explanation for persistent orientation tuning as observed in the visual cortex.  Our analytical results confirm those of simulations done by Von der Malsburg [4] and provide a starting point for further analytical treatment of less restricted stimuli.
