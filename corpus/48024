Attractor Dynamics in Feedforward Neural Networks
 We study the probabilistic generative models parameterized by feedforward neural networks.  An attractor dynamics for probabilistic inference in these models is derived from a mean field approximation for large, layered sigmoidal networks.  Fixed points of the dynamics correspond to solutions of the mean field equations, which relate the statistics of each unit to those of its Markov blanket.  We establish globalconvergence of the dynamics by providing a Lyapunov function and show that the dynamics generate the signals required for unsupervised learning.  Our results for feedforwardnetworks provide a counterpart to those of Cohen-Grossberg and Hopfield for symmetric networks.
