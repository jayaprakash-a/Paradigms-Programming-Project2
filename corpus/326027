Some Geometric Results in Semidefinite Programming
 Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to develop certain geometric results concerning the feasible regions of Semidefinite Programs, called here Spectrahedra.  We first develop a characterization for the faces of spectrahedra.  More specifically, given a point x in a spectrahedron, we derive an expression for the unique face whose relative interior contains x.  Among other things, this is shown to yield characterizations for extreme points and extreme rays of spectrahedra.  We then introduce the notion of an algebraic polar of a spectrahedron, and present its relation to the usual geometric polar.  The results imply a "gap-free" optimality criterion for spectrahedral cones.  We also report some results on the polyhedrality of spectrahedra.
