Searching the Web by Voice
 Abstract Spoken queries are a natural medium for searching the Web in settings where typing on a keyboard is not practical.  This paper describes a speech interface to the Google search engine.  We present experiments with various statistical language models, concluding that a unigram model with collocations provides the best combination of broad coverage, predictive power, and real-time performance.  We also report accuracy results of the prototype system.
