Translation invariant classification of non-stationary signals
 Abstract.  Non-stationary signal classification is a difficult and complex problem.  On top of that, we add the following hypothesis: each signal includes a discriminant waveform, the time location of which is random and unknown.  This is a problem that may arise in Brain Computer Interface (BCI).  The aim of this article is to provide a new description to classify this kind of data.  This representation must characterize the waveform without reference to the absolute time location of the pattern in the signal.  We will show that it is possible to create a signal description using graphs on a time-scale representation.  The definition of an inner product between graphs is then required to implement classification algorithm.  Our experimental results showed that this approach is very promising.
