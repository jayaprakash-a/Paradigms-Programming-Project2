Physiological pharmacokinetic analysis using population modeling and informative prior distributions \Lambda
 Abstract We describe a general approach using Bayesian analysis for the estimation of parameters in physiological pharmacokinetic models.  The chief statistical difficulty in estimation with these models is that any physiological model that is even approximately realistic will have a large number of parameters, often comparable to the number of observations in a typical pharmacokinetic experiment (for example, 28 measurements and 15 parameters for each subject).  In addition, the parameters are generally poorly identified, akin to the well-known ill-conditioned problem of estimating a mixture of declining exponentials.  Our modeling includes (1) hierarchical population modeling as in Wakefield (1994), which allows partial pooling of information among different experimental subjects; (2) a pharmacokinetic model including compartments for well-perfused tissues, poorly-perfused tissues, fat, and the liver; and (3) informative prior distributions for population parameters, which is possible be\Lambda Scheduled to appear (with figures) in the Applications and Case Studies section of the Journal of the American Statistical Association, December, 1996 cause the parameters represent real physiological variables.  We discuss how to estimate the models using Bayesian posterior simulation, a method that automatically includes the uncertainty inherent in estimating such a large number of parameters (see, e. g. , Wakefield et al. , 1994).  We also discuss how to check model fit and sensitivity to the prior distribution using posterior predictive simulation.  We illustrate the application to the toxicokinetics of tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PERC), the problem that motivated this work.
