Guided and defect modes in periodic dielectric waveguides
 The nature of guided modes and defect modes in periodic dielectric waveguides is investigated computationally for model systems in two dimensions.  It is shown that defect states that exist within the band gap of guided modes can be excited to form tightly localized high-Q resonances.
