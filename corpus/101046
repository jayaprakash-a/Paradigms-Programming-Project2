Continuous Dynamic Time Warping for Translation-Invariant Curve Alignment with Applications to Signature Verification
 Abstract The problem of establishing correspondence and measuring the similarity of a pair of planar curves arises in many applications in computer vision and pattern recognition.  This paper presents a new method for comparing planar curves and for performing matching at sub-sampling resolution.  The analysis of the algorithm as well as its structural properties are described.  The performance of the new technique applied to the problem of signature verification is shown and compared with the performance of the well-known Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.
