Unsupervised Learning in Networks of Spiking Neurons Using Temporal Coding
 Abstract.  We propose a mechanism for unsupervised learning in networks of spiking neurons which is based on the timing of single firing events.  Our results show that a topology preserving behaviour quite similar to that of Kohonen's self-organizing map can be achieved using temporal coding.  In contrast to previous approaches, which use rate coding, the winner among competing neurons can be determined fast and locally.  Hence our model is a further step towards a more realistic description of unsupervised learning in biological neural systems.
