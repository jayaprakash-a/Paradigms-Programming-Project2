Efficient Face Detection by a Cascaded Support Vector Machine Expansion
 We describe a fast system for the detection and localization of human faces in images using a nonlinear Support Vector Machine.  We approximate the decision surface in terms of a reduced set of expansion vectors and propose a cascaded evaluation which has the property that the full support vectors expansion is only evaluated on the face-like parts of the image, while the largest part of typical images is classified using a single expansion vector (simpler and more efficient classifier).  The cascaded evaluation offers a thirty-fold speed-up over an evaluation using the full set of reduced set vectors which itself already is thirty times faster than classification using all the support vectors.
