Discovering Latent Classes in Relational Data
 We present a framework for learning abstract relational knowledge with the aim of explaining how people acquire intuitive theories of physical, biological, or social systems.  Our approach is based on a generative relational model with latent classes, and simultaneously determines the kinds of entities that exist in a domain, the number of these latent classes, and the relations between classes that are possible or likely.  This model goes beyond previous psychological models of category learning, which consider attributes associated with individual categories but not relationships between categories.  We apply this domain-general framework to two specific problems: learning the structure of kinship systems and learning causal theories.
