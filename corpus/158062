Time Optimal Self-Stabilizing Synchronization Extended Abstract
 Abstract In this paper we present a time optimal self-stabilizing scheme for network synchronization.  Our construction has two parts.  First, we give a simple rule by which each node can compute its pulse number as a function of its neighbors' pulse numbers.  The rule we give stabilizes in time bounded by the diameter of the network, does not invoke global operations, and does not require any additional memory space.  However, it assumes that pulse numbers may grow unboundedly.  The second part of the construction (which is of independent interest on its own right) takes care of this problem.  Specifically, we present the first self-stabilizing reset procedure that stabilizes in time proportional to the diameter of the network.
