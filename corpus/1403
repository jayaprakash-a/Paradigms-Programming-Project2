An Analog Implementation of the Constant Average Statistics Constraint For Sensor Calibration
 Abstract We use the constant statistics constraint to calibrate an array of sensors that contains gain and offset variations.  This algorithm has been mapped to analog hardware and designed and fabricated with a 2um CMOS technology.  Measured results from the chip show that the system achieves invariance to gain and offset variations of the input signal.
