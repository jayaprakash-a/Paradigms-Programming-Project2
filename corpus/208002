Biases in white noise analysis due to non-Poisson spike generation
 Abstract White noise analysis methods for characterizing neurons typically ignore the dynamics of neural spike generation, assuming that spikes arise from an inhomogeneous Poisson process.  We show that when spikes arise from a leakyintegrate-and--re mechanism, a classical white noise estimate of a neuron's temporal receptive -eld is signi-cantlybiased.  We develop a modi-ed estimator for linear characterization of such neurons, and demonstrate its e/ectiveness in simulation.  Finally, we apply it to physiological data and show that spiking dynamics may account for changes observed in the receptive -elds measured at di/erent contrasts.
