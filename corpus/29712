Experience with Rover Navigation for Lunar-Like Terrains
 Abstract Reliable navigation is critical for a lunar rover, both for autonomous traverses and safeguarded, remote teleoperation.  This paper describes an implemented system that has autonomously driven a prototype wheeled lunar rover over a kilometer in natural, outdoor terrain.  The navigation system uses stereo terrain maps to perform local obstacle avoidance, and arbitrates steering recommendations from both the user and the rover.  The paper describes the system architecture, each of the major components, and the experimental results to date.
