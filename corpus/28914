Projected Gradient Methods for Non-negative Matrix Factorization
 Abstract Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a problem of bound-constrained optimization, a well studied area in theory and practice.  However, so far there is no study formally applying bound-constrained optimization techniques to NMF.  In this paper, we propose two projectedgradient type methods for NMF.  The new methods have sound optimization properties.  We discuss their efficient implementations and show that one proposed method converges faster than the popular multiplicative update approach.  A simple MATLAB code is provided.
