Proceedings of the 18th Annual Conference on Learning Theory, 2005 Learnability of Bipartite Ranking Functions
 Abstract.  The problem of ranking, in which the goal is to learn a real-valued ranking function that induces a ranking or ordering over an instance space, has recently gained attention in machine learning.  We define a model of learnability for ranking functions in a particular setting of the ranking problem known as the bipartite ranking problem, and derive a number of results in this model.  Our first main result provides a sufficient condition for the learnability of a class of ranking functions F : we show that F is learnable if its bipartite rank-shatter coefficients, which measure the richness of a ranking function class in the same way as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefficients (growth function) for classes of classification functions, do not grow too quickly.  Our second main result gives a necessary condition for learnability: we define a new combinatorial parameter for a class of ranking functions F that we term the rank dimension of F , and show that F is learnable only if its rank dimension is finite.  Finally, we investigate questions of the computational complexity of learning ranking functions.
