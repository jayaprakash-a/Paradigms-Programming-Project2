-A Review of Frame Technology
 Abstract Frame Technology was introduced during the early 1980's as an approach to providing significant levels of improvement in software productivity through adaptive reuse.  However, despite the claims of order of magnitude improvements and reuse levels of 90%, this technology does not appear to have acquired a corresponding level of popularity, appearing to loose out to the more recent technologies of generative programming and aspect oriented programming.  Our interest frame technology stems from our work on the meta-modelling of feature models to support the expression of product line architectures in the UML using a meta-modelling research tool.  Whist the tool provides direct support for templates, we sought an approach that would approximate to customisable templates, allowing us to generate specific configurations in response to user choices by severing unused features.  Frame Technology appears to offer a potential solution and we present a summary of our investigation of this technology.  Finally, we propose future directions of study based around a meta-modelling approach.
