Minimal Projective Reconstruction for Combinations of Points and Lines in Three Views
 Abstract In this paper we address the problem of projective reconstruction of structure and motion given only image data.  In particular we investigate three novel minimal combinations of points and lines over three views, and give complete solutions and reconstruction methods for two of these cases: "four points and three lines in three views", and "two points and six lines in three views".  We show that in general there are three and seven solutions respectively to these cases.  The reconstruction methods are tested on real and simulated data.  We also give tentative results for the case of nine lines in correspondence over three views, where experiments indicate that there may be up to 36 complex solutions.
