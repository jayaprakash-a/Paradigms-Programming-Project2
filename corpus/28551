Multi-Frame Infinitesimal Motion Model for the Reconstruction of (Dynamic) Scenes with Multiple Linearly Moving Objects
 Abstract We introduce new small-motion multi-frame equations applicable to the reconstruction of dynamic scenes in which points are allowed to move along straight-line paths with constant velocity.  The motion equations apply to both static and dynamic points, thus prior segmentation is not necessary.  We present a reconstruction algorithm of camera motion, scene structure, and point trajectories embedded into a multi-frame factorization principle which requires the minimum of 11 images and 7 points (out of which at least 3 are dynamic).
