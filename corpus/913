Automatic summarization of voicemail messages using lexical and prosodic features
 Abstract This paper presents trainable methods for extracting principal content words from voicemail messages.  The short text summaries generated are suitable for mobile messaging applications.  The system uses a set of classifiers to identify the summary words, with each word being identified by a vector of lexical and prosodic features.  We use an ROC-based algorithm, Parcel, to select input features (and classifiers).  We have performed a series of objective and subjective evaluations using unseen data from two different speech recognition systems, as well as human transcriptions of voicemail speech.
