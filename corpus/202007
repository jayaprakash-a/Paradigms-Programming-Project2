Linear Projective Reconstruction from Matching Tensors
 Abstract This paper describes initial work on a family of projective reconstruction techniques that extract projection matrices directly and linearly from matching tensors estimated from image data.  The simplest methods use fundamental matrices and epipoles, alternative ones use trilinear tensors.  All of the data is treated uniformly, and there is no reliance on `privileged' images or tokens.  The approach is based on `joint image closure relations' --- bilinear constraints between matching tensors and projection matrices, that express the fact that the former derive from the latter.  The performance of the new techniques is quantified and compared with that of several existing methods.
