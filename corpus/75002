Low Latency Decoding of EG LDPC Codes
 Abstract We describe simple iterative decoders for low-density parity check codes based on Euclidean geometries, suitable for practical VLSI implementation in applications requiring very fast decoders.  The decoders are based on shuffled and replica-shuffled versions of iterative bit-flipping and quantized weighted bit-flipping schemes.  The proposed decoders converge faster and provide better ultimate performance than standard bit-flipping decoders.  We present simulations that illustrate the performance versus complexity trade-offs for thes decoders.  We can show in some cases through importance sampling that no significant error-floor exists.
