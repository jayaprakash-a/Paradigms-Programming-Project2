A Sparse Probabilistic Learning Algorithm for Real-Time Tracking
 Abstract This paper addresses the problem of applying powerful pattern recognition algorithms based on kernels to efficient visual tracking.  Recently Avidan [1] has shown that object recognizers using kernel-SVMs can be elegantly adapted to localization by means of spatial perturbation of the SVM, using optic flow.  Whereas Avidan's SVM applies to each frame of a video independently of other frames, the benefits of temporal fusion of data are well known.  This issue is addressed here by using a fully probabilistic `Relevance Vector Machine' (RVM) to generate observations with Gaussian distributions that can be fused over time.  To improve performance further, rather than adapting a recognizer, we build a localizer directly using the regression form of the RVM.  A classification SVM is used in tandem, for object verification, and this provides the capability of automatic initialization and recovery.  The approach is demonstrated in real-time face and vehicle tracking systems.  The `sparsity' of the RVMs means that only a fraction of CPU time is required to track at frame rate.  Tracker output is demonstrated in a camera management task in which zoom and pan are controlled in response to speaker/vehicle position and orientation, over an extended period.  The advantages of temporal fusion in this system are demonstrated.
