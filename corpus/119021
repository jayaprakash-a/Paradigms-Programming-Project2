SALIENCY-BASED MULTI-FOVEATED MPEG COMPRESSION
 ABSTRACT Most current foveation strategies are limited to foveating sequences based on a direct measurement or an implicit assumption of the gaze direction.  Such approaches often fail in unconstrained environments or when necessary equipment is absent.  Alternatively, a computational model of visual attention may be used to predict visually salient locations.  We describe such a neurobiological model of attention and its specific application to foveated video compression.  The algorithm is demonstrated to be successful in foveating to Regions Of human Interest in a variety of video segments, including synthetic as well as natural scenes, and also gives good compression ratios.
