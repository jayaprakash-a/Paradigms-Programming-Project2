Learning Dynamical Models Using Expectation-Maximisation
 Abstract Tracking with deformable contours in a filtering framework requires a dynamical model for prediction.  For any given application, tracking is improved by having an accurate model, learned from training data.  We develop a method for learning dynamical models from training sequences, explicitly taking account of the fact that training data are noisy measurements and not true states.  By introducing an `augmentedstate smoothing filter', we show how the technique of Expectation-Maximisation can be applied to this problem, and show that the resulting algorithm produces more robust and accurate tracking.
