 Preface The developers of modern embedded systems feel the need of automatic development tools such as Functional Simulator, Timing Simulator, Cross compiler, Disassembler etc.  for faster development.  These tools help them in verifying their design early in the design cycle and for studying various design tradeoffs.  Such tools put together can form an integrated environment, where the designers can specify their designs in a high level language and use these tools for verification and exploring various design parameters.  These tools are also heavily used by researchers for specifying next generation Instruction Sets and microarchitectures.
