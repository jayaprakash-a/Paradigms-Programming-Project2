Using a DEM to Determine Geospatial Object Trajectories
 Abstract This paper addresses the estimation of moving object trajectories within a geospatial coordinate system, using a network of video sensors.  A high-resolution (0. 5m grid spacing) digital elevation map (DEM) has been constructed using a helicopter-based laser rangefinder.  Object locations are estimated by intersecting viewing rays from a calibrated sensor platform with the DEM.  Continuous object trajectories can then be assembled from sequences of single-frame location estimates using spatio-temporal filtering and domain knowledge.
