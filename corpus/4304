The linking homomorphism of one-dimensional minimal sets
 Abstract We introduce a way of characterizing the linking of one-dimensional minimal sets in threedimensional flows and carry out the characterization for some minimal sets within flows modelled by templates, with an emphasis on the linking of Denjoy continua.  We also show that any aperiodic minimal subshift of minimal block growth has a suspension which is homeomorphic to a Denjoy continuum.
