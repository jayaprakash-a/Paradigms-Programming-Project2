Conditions for Cognition
 Abstract The application of Marr's notions of computational theory to data on classical and operant conditioning suggests computational and neural frameworks into which learning algorithms fit.  This allow connections to be made between these algorithms and theoretical notions of what behaviour is appropriate, coming in this case from dynamic programming and Kalman filtering.  It also helps to reconcile apparently conflicting results.
