Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams and Minimal Trellises
 Abstract Ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) are graph-based data structures for representing Boolean functions.  They have found widespread use in computer-aided design and in formal verification of digital circuits.  Minimal trellises are graphical representations of error-correcting codes that play a prominent role in coding theory.  This paper establishes a close connection between these two graphical models, as follows.  Let C be a binary code of length n, and let f C (x 1 ;:::;x n ) be the Boolean function that takes the value 0 at x 1 ;:::;x n if and only if (x 1 ;:::;x n ) 2 C .  Given this natural one-to-one correspondence between Boolean functions and binary codes, we prove that the minimal proper trellis for a code C with minimum distance d } 1 is isomorphic to the singleterminal OBDD for its Boolean indicator function f C (x 1 ;:::;x n ).  Prior to this result, the extensive research during the past decade on binary decision diagrams { in computer engineering { and on minimal trellises { in coding theory { has been carried out independently.  As outlined in this work, the realization that binary decision diagrams and minimal trellises are essentially the same data structure opens up a range of promising possibilities for transfer of ideas between these disciplines.
