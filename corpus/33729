Neural Networks in Economics: Background, Applications and New Developments
 Abstract Neural Networks were developed in the sixties as devices for classification and regression.  The approach was originally inspired from Neuroscience.  Its attractiveness lies in the ability to "learn", i. e.  to generalize to as yet unseen observations.  One aim of this paper is to give an introduction to the technique of Neural Networks and an overview of the most popular architectures.  We start from statistical learning theory to introduce the basics of learning.  Then, we give an overview of the general principles of neural networks and of their use in the field of Economics.  A second purpose is to introduce a recently developed Neural Network Learning technique, so called Support Vector Network Learning, which is an application of ideas from statistical learning theory.  This approach has shown very promising results on problems with a limited amount of training examples.  Moreover, utilizing a technique that is known as the kernel trick, Support Vector Networks can easily be adapted to nonlinear models.  Finally, we present an economic application of this approach from the field of preference learning.
