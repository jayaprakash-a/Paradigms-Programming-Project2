The Power of Selective Memory: Self-Bounded Learning of Prediction Suffix Trees
 Abstract Prediction suffix trees (PST) provide a popular and effective tool for tasks such as compression, classification, and language modeling.  In this paper we take a decision theoretic view of PSTs.  Generalizing the notion of margin to PSTs, we present an online PST learning algorithm and derive a mistake bound for it.  We then describe a self-bounded enhancement of our learning algorithm for which the learning process automatically grows a bounded-depth PST.  We also prove a similar mistake-bound for the self-bounded algorithm.  The result is an efficient algorithm that neither relies on a-priori assumptions on the shape or maximal depth of the target PST nor does it require any parameters.  To our knowledge, this is the first provably-correct PST learning algorithm which generates a bounded-depth PST while being competitive with any fixed PST determined in hindsight.
