Revisiting Single-View Shape Tensors: Theory and Applications
 Abstract.  Given the projection of a sucient number of points it is possible to algebraically eliminate the camera parameters and obtain viewinvariant functions of image coordinates and space coordinates.  These single view invariants have been introduced in the past, however, they are not as well understood as their dual multi-view tensors.  In this paper we revisit the dual tensors (bilinear, trilinear and quadlinear), both the general and the reference-plane reduced version, and describe the complete set of synthetic constraints, properties of the tensor slices, reprojection equations, non-linear constraints and reconstruction formulas.  We then apply some of the new results, such as the dual reprojection equations, for multi-view point tracking under occlusions.
