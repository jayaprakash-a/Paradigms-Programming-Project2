Learning Semitic Vocalizations with Hidden Markov Models
 Abstract Semitic languages present a special problem for natural language processing in that most of the vowels are omitted from written prose.  Thus a natural and often necessary preprocessing step for Semitic text is vocalization, or "pointing", of the text: filling in the vowels and diacritical marks.  Unvocalized Hebrew contains many more ambiguities than English text; conversely, vocalized Hebrew is considerably less ambiguous than English.  The pointed text could then be used directly or fed into parsers, translators, or text-to-speech engines.  This paper demonstrates that hidden Markov models may be a useful tool for automatic vocalizations of Semitic texts.
