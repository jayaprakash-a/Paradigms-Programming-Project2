A new approach to qualitative stereo
 measurements surements A growing body of work in computer vision and visual perception is aimed at exploiting the advantages of the qualitative approach to the representation and processing of visual information [1].  According to the proponents of qualitative vision, trading precision for robustness can yield stable and noise-free representations without sacrificing utility for real-world tasks.  A typical qualitative method starts with a set of measurements (which themselves are, most frequently, quantitative), and derives from them a representation in which only certain qualitative features pertinent to the task are retained.  In binocular stereopsis, for example, one may process disparity data to compute qualitative characteristics of the surface such as the sign of its Gaussian curvature [16], instead of trying to recover surface depth.  In the present work, we show that it is possible to derive a quantitative representation from an intermediate set of qualitative data which satisfy certain simple constraints.  By relying, on the one hand, on ordinal intermediate representations, and by supporting, on the other hand, the extraction of metric information, the proposed method combines the advantages of both qualitative and classical approaches.  The method is illustrated on the example of stereopsis, although it is applicable also to the processing of other visual cues, as well as to the integration of several cues within a common computational framework.  \Lambda To whom correspondence should be addressed.  a 2 B x z y f. p.  l l L R R' P Figure 1: The viewing geometry assumed in the derivation of eq.  4.  2 Depth from pairwise disparity differences 2. 1 Binocular viewing geometry Consider two images of the same object, taken from viewpoints L and R, with the two cameras or eyes aimed at a common fixation point fp (see Figure 1).  Assuming that the baseline B is small compared to the distance to the object (B !! l), we can treat the right image as if it is taken from R 0 instead of R.  We place the origin of the coordinate system in which the depth will be reconstructed at the fixation point fp, so that the X-axis is parallel to the baseline LR 0 and the Z-axis coincides with the normal to LR 0 through fp.  In this coordinate system, a point P = (P x ; P y ; P z ) T is projected onto the left image as: P l x = P x cos ff + P z sin ff \Gamma P x sin ff + P z cos ff + l (1) and to the right image as: P r x = P x cos ff \Gamma P z sin ff P x sin ff + P z cos ff + l (2) where the angle ff is as depicted in Figure 1.  Consider now two points, P and Q, and define disparity differences (\Deltal \Gamma \Deltar) P;Q : = i P l x \Gamma Q l x j \Gamma (P r x \Gamma Q r x ) = i P l x \Gamma P r x j \Gamma i Q l x \Gamma Q r x j = ` P x cos ff + P z sin ff \Gamma P x sin ff + P z cos ff + l \Gamma Q x cos ff + Q z sin ff \Gamma Q x sin ff +Q z cos ff + l ' \Gamma
