Vision-based ACC with a Single Camera: Bounds on Range and Range Rate Accuracy
 Abstract This paper describes a Vision-based Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system which uses a single camera as input.  In particular we discuss how to compute range and range-rate from a single camera and discuss how the imaging geometry affects the range and range rate accuracy.  We determine the bound on the accuracy given a particular configuration.  These bounds in turn determine what steps must be made to achieve good performance.  The system has been implemented on a test vehicle and driven on various highways over thousands of miles.
