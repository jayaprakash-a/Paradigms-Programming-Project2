Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines
 Abstract We introduce a semi-supervised support vector machine (S 3 VM) method.  Given a training set of labeled data and a working set of unlabeled data, S 3 VM constructs a support vector machine using both the training and working sets.  We use S 3 VM to solve the transduction problem using overall risk minimization (ORM) posed by Vapnik.  The transduction problem is to estimate the value of a classification function at the given points in the working set.  This contrasts with the standard inductive learning problem of estimating the classification function at all possible values and then using the fixed function to deduce the classes of the working set data.  We propose a general S 3 VM model that minimizes both the misclassification error and the function capacity based on all the available data.  We show how the S 3 VM model for 1-norm linear support vector machines can be converted to a mixed-integer program and then solved exactly using integer programming.  Results of S 3 VM and the standard 1-norm support vector machine approach are compared on eleven data sets.  Our computational results support the statistical learning theory results showing that incorporating working data improves generalization when insu#cient training information is available.  In every case, S 3 VM either improved or showed no significant difference in generalization compared to the traditional approach.
