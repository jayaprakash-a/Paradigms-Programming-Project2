Hierarchical Learning and Planning Using Multi-Scale Models
 Abstract We study multi-scale learning and planning in partially observable environments using the framework of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs).  HHMMs are tree-based structures which enable variable resolution modeling of sequential stochastic data.  We undertake a detailed study of the HHMM framework using a real indoor robot navigation problem.  Our results show several advantages of HHMM models compared to standard HMM models, including a better fit to the training data, better localization of the robot, and more rapid model learning through \reuse" of previously learned sub-models.  We also describe a case study of planning with HHMM models and extend these models to include abstract and primitive actions.  We describe a hierarchical planning algorithm for HHMM models with actions that works better than a standard POMDP planning heuristic (MLS) on a simulated oce navigation task.
