On the Capabilities of Higher-Order Neurons: A Radial Basis Function Approach
 Abstract Higher-order neurons with k monomials in n variables are shown to have Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension at least nk + 1.  This result supersedes the previously known lower bound obtained via k-term monotone disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas.  Moreover, it implies that the VC dimension of higher-order neurons with k monomials is strictly larger than the VC dimension of k-term monotone DNF.  The result is achieved by introducing an exponential approach that employs Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) neural networks for obtaining classifications of points in terms of higherorder neurons.
