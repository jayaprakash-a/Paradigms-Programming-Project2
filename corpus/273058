On the Sample Complexity of Learning Bayesian Networks
 Abstract In recent years there has been an increasing interest in learning Bayesian networks from data.  One of the most effective methods for learning such networks is based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle.  Previous work has shown that this learning procedure is asymptotically successful: with probability one, it will converge to the target distribution, given a sufficient number of samples.  However, the rate of this convergence has been hitherto unknown.  In this work we examine the sample complexity of MDL based learning procedures for Bayesian networks.  We show that the number of samples needed to learn an ffl-close approximation (in terms of entropy distance) with confidence ffi is O i ( 1 ffl ) 4 3 log 1 ffl log 1 ffi log log 1 ffi j .  This means that the sample complexity is a low-
