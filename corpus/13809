Detecting Acromegaly: Screening for Disease with a Morphable Model
 Abstract Acromegaly is a rare disorder which affects approximately 50 out of every million people.  The disease is typically caused when a tumor of the pituitary gland secretes excess growth hormone, causing swelling of the hands, feet, and face, and eventually permanent changes due to abnormal bone growth in areas such as the jaw, the brow ridge, and the cheek bones.  Because the disease is so rare and the onset of symptoms is slow, it is often missed by general practitioners and other health care professionals.  This means that the disease often progresses beyond where it might if it were identified and treated earlier.  In this work, we consider a semi-automated approach to detecting the presence of acromegaly in people, using a supervised learning paradigm.  We built a training set of images by taking frontal photographs of 24 acromegalic patients and photographs of 25 disease-free subjects.  Because the recognition of acromegaly is dependent upon subtle features which are difficult to detect locally in the image, we decided upon a more global method of modelling that uses information across the entire photograph.  In particular, we modelled each subject's face in an analysisby-synthesis loop using the three-dimensional morphable face model of Blanz and Vetter [2].  The parameters of the morphable model capture many features of the threedimensional shape of the subject's head from just a single photograph and are excellent features with which to classify subjects as either acromegalic or not.  We report encouraging results of a classifier built from the training set of real human subjects.
