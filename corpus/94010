A Mixed-Signal Approach to High-Performance, Low-Power Linear Filters
 ABSTRACT We present a new approach to the design of high-performance, low-power linear filters.  We use p-channel synapse transistors as analog memory cells, and mixed-signal circuits for fast, lowpower arithmetic.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have built a 16-tap, 7-bit, 200MHz, mixed-signal FIR filter that consumes 3mW at 3. 3V.  The filter uses synapse pFETs to store the analog tap-coefficients, electron tunneling and hot-electron injection to modify the coefficient values, digital registers for the delay line, and multiplying digital-to-analog converters to multiply the digital delay-line values with the analog tap-coefficients.  The measured maximum clock speed is 225MHz; the measured tap-multiplier resolution is 7 bits at 200MHz.  The total die area is 0. 13mm 2 .  We can readily scale our design to longer delay lines.
