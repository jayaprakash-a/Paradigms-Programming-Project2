Correction methods for three-dimensional reconstructions from confocal images: I
 tissue shrinking and axial scaling.  Abstract We show here, using locust wholemount ganglia as an example, that scaling artifacts in three-dimensional reconstructions from confocal microscopic images due to refractive index mismatch in the light
