Morphology-Based Language Modeling for Arabic Speech Recognition
 Abstract Language modeling is a difficult problem for languages with rich morphology.  In this paper we investigate the use of morphology-based language models at different stages in a speech recognition system for conversational Arabic.  Classbased and single-stream factored language models using morphological word representations are applied within an N-best list rescoring framework.  In addition, we explore the use of factored language models in first-pass recognition, which is facilitated by two novel procedures: the data-driven optimization of a multi-stream language model structure, and the conversion of a factored language model to a standard word-based model.  We evaluate these techniques on a large-vocabulary recognition task and demonstrate that they lead to perplexity and word error rate reductions.
