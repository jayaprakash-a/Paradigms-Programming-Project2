Camera Calibration from Points and Lines in Dual-Space Geometry
 Abstract Camera calibration is essential to many computer vision applications.  Most existing calibration algorithms in the literature consist of estimating both intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters through non-linear iterative minimizations using only point features.  We show that using lines and planes in a consistant framework allows to first entirely decouple intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then extract closed form solutions for them making optimal use of the geometrical constraints existing in the scene.  We introduce a new formalism, which we call `dual space', that allows one to represent cleanly and intuitively many useful geometrical relashionships between planes, lines and points in space, and lines and points on the image plane.  Calibration results are presented on real images retrieved from a standard image database.
