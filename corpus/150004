PROSODIC KNOWLEDGE SOURCES FOR AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION
 ABSTRACT In this work, different prosodic knowledge sources are integrated into a state-of-the-art large vocabulary speech recognition system.  Prosody manifests itself on different levels in the speech signal: within the words as a change in phone durations and pitch, inbetween the words as a variation in the pause length, and beyond the words, correlating with higher linguistic structures and nonlexical phenomena.  We investigate three models, each exploiting a different level of prosodic information, in rescoring N-best hypotheses according to how well recognized words correspond to prosodic features of the utterance.  Experiments on the Switchboard corpus show word accuracy improvements with each prosodic knowledge source.  A further improvement is observed with the combination of all models, demonstrating that they each capture somewhat different prosodic characteristics of the speech signal.
