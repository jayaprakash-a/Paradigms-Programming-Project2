An Exploration of Entity Models, Collective Classification and Relation Description
 ABSTRACT Traditional information retrieval typically represents data using a bag of words; data mining typically uses a highly structured database representation.  This paper explores the middle ground using a representation which we term entity models, in which questions about structured data may be posed and answered, but the complexities and task-specific restrictions of ontologies are avoided.  An entity model is a language model or word distribution associated with an entity, such as a person, place or organization.  Using these perentity language models, entities may be clustered, links may be detected or described with a short summary, entities may be collectively classified, and question answering may be performed.  On a corpus of entities extracted from newswire and the Web, we group entities by profession with 90% accuracy, improve accuracy further on the task of classifying politicians as liberal or conservative using collective classification and conditional random fields, and answer questions about "who a person is" with mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0. 52.
