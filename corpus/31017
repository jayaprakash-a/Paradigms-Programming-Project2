Regret Minimization Under Partial Monitoring
 Abstract We consider repeated games in which the player, instead of observing the action chosen by the opponent in each game round, receives a feedback generated by the combined choice of the two players.  We study Hannan consistent players for these games, that is, randomized playing strategies whose per-round regret vanishes with probability one as the number n of game rounds goes to infinity.  We prove a general lower bound of #(n- 1/3 ) for the convergence rate of the regret, and exhibit a specific strategy that attains this rate for any game for which a Hannan consistent player exists.
