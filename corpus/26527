Analog VLSI Architectures for Motion Processing: From Fundamental Limits to System Applications
 Abstract: We discuss some of the fundamental issues in the design of highly-parallel, dense, low-power motion sensors in analog VLSI.  Since photoreceptor circuits are an integral part of all visual motion sensors, we discuss how the sizing of photosensitive areas can affect the performance of such systems.  We review the classic gradient and correlation algorithms and give a survey of analog motion-sensing architectures inspired by them.  We calculate how the measurable speed range scales with signal-tonoise ratio for a classic Reichardt sensor with a fixed time constant.  We show how this speed range may be improved using a nonlinear filter with an adaptive time constant, constructed out of a diode and a capacitor, and present data from a velocity sensor based on such a filter.  Finally, we describe how arrays of such velocity sensors can be employed to compute the heading direction of a moving subject and to estimate the time-to-contact between the sensor and a moving object.
