Word Normalization for On-Line Handwritten Word Recognition
 Abstract We introduce a new approach to normalizing words written with an electronic stylus that applies to all styles of handwriting (upper case, lower case, printed, cursive, or mixed).  A geometrical model of the word spatial structure is fitted to the pen trajectory using the EM algorithm.  The fitting process maximizes the likelihood of the trajectory given the model and a set a priors on its parameters.  The method was evaluated and integrated to a recognition system that combines neural networks and hidden Markov models.
