Improved Computation of
 Abstract We present a computational method for determination of the isotopomer distributions of metabolites from the data generated by a tandem mass spetrometer.  The method is an improvement over existing method in two aspects: First, the method is able to deal with overlapping fragments in the daughter ion spectra.  Second, the method intertwines the correction step for natural abundance of higher isotopes with the step relating the mass isotopomers to positional isotopomers.  This results in a more efficient utilization of the spectral data.
