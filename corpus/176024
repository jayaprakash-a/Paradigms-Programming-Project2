Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Label Propagation
 Abstract We investigate the use of unlabeled data to help labeled data in classification.  We propose a simple iterative algorithm, label propagation, to propagate labels through the dataset along high density areas defined by unlabeled data.  We give the analysis of the algorithm, show its solution, and its connection to several other algorithms.  We also show how to learn parameters by minimum spanning tree heuristic and entropy minimization, and the algorithm's ability to do feature selection.  Experiment results are promising.
