Java Security Architecture and Extension in Practice
 Abstract In this article, we report on experiences with the JCA/JCE and existing Java Security Providers (short: providers) that we drew from building provider- and algorithm-independent support for PKCS#7 based on the JCA/JCE.  A number of problems came to our attention which were caused by shortcomings in the JCA and in a number of existing Java Security Providers.  The repetitive pattern of these shortcomings suggests that they are likely of general interest for those building either providers or software that shall function independent of particular providers or a particular cryptographic algorithm.
