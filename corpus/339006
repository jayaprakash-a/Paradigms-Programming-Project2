Implications of Prosody Modeling for Prosody Recognition
 Abstract This paper introduces Stem-ML, which is a model of the prosody generation process with an associated description language, and suggests how it may help prosody recognition.  We applied Stem-ML modeling to three topics: the modeling of prosodic strengths, intonation types, and noun phrase patterns.  Stem-ML parameters derived from )&* contours may have a more consistent relationship with prosodic events than raw )#* values.  This may improve identification of accent classes, accent strengths, and intonation types.
