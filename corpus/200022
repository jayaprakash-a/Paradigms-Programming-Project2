NONPARAMETRIC CHANGE DETECTION IN 2D RANDOM SENSOR FIELD
 ABSTRACT The problem of detecting changes from data collected from a largescale randomly deployed two dimensional sensor field is considered.  Under a nonparametric change detection framework, we propose detection algorithms using two measures of change.  Theoretical performance guarantee is derived from the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory.  By exploiting the structures of the search domain, we design a suboptimal recursive algorithm to detect the area of largest change which, for M sample points, runs in time O(M 2 log M) (compared to an O(M 4 ) required for a straightforward exhaustive search).  The lost of performance diminishes as M increases.
