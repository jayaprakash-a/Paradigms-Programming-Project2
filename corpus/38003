Model Selection for Small Sample Regression
 Abstract.  Model selection is an important ingredient of many machine learning algorithms, in particular when the sample size in small, in order to strike the right trade-off between overfitting and underfitting.  Previous classical results for linear regression are based on an asymptotic analysis.  We present a new penalization
