What is a Dollar Worth? The Market Value of Cash Holdings
 Abstract This study investigates the market value of cash held by firms.  In general, we estimate the value shareholders place on a marginal dollar of cash to be about $0. 97.  However, we find large cross-sectional differences consistent with existing theory.  We document that the quality and volatility of the firm's investment opportunity set as well as the probability of financial distress and capital market access impact the value shareholders place on cash holdings.  Firms with good growth options have their cash valued at a premium to those with poor growth prospects.  Additionally, cash is valued less in firms with stable investment programs and those nearer to financial distress.  Finally, we find that access to the capital markets affects shareholder's valuation of cash holdings, although the results are contrary to expectations.  Overall, it appears that the investment opportunity set rather than the financing opportunity set of the firm affects the value that shareholders place on a firm's cash holdings.
