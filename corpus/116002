A Blessing of Dimensionality: Measure Concentration and Probabilistic Inference
 Abstract This paper proposes an ecient sampling method for inference in probabilistic graphical models.  The method exploits a blessing of dimensionality known as the concentration of measure phenomenon in order to derive analytic expressions for proposal distributions.  The method can also be interpreted in a variational setting, were one minimises an upperbound on the estimator variance.  The results on simple settings are very promising.  We believe this method has great potential in graphical models used for diagnosis.
