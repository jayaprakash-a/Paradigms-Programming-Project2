Model-based invariants for 3D vision
 Abstract Invariance under a group of 3D transformations seems a desirable component of an efficient 3D shape representation.  We propose representations which are invariant under weak perspective to either rigid or affine 3D transformations, and we show how they can be computed efficiently from a sequence of images with a linear and incremental algorithm.  We show simulated results with perspective projection and noise, and the results of model acquisition from a real sequence of images.  The use of linear computation, together with the integration through time of invariant representations, offers improved robustness and stability.  Using these invariant representations, we derive model-based projective invariant functions of general 3D objects.  We discuss the use of the model-based invariants with existing recognition strategies: alignment without transformation, and constant time indexing from 2D images of general 3D objects.
