Bringing Camila and Sets Together --- the
 Introduction The presentation of the Camila [ABNO97a] Toolset at AMAST'97 [ABNO97b] includes two demos --bams. cam and ppd. cam --- which show how incremental data refinement is supported by the prototype / implementation hybridization primitives available in the Toolset.  The process of animating each of these data refinement case studies is hard to understand if unaccompanied by the underlying mathematical calculations in the Sets calculus [Oli90, Oli92, Oli97] 1 .  Bridging the gap between theory and practice, this document not only outlines such mathematical calculations which lead to the provided relational model implementations, but also shows how such a process can be partly automated and animated in the Toolset.  A synopsis of Sets is presented in Appendix A.  This should be read in advance by those unfamiliar with this program calculus.  Reference [AB91] is suggested for those unfamiliar with the Camila syntax and environment.  By inspecting the present L A T E X source, readers will have an opportunity to understand how additional tools in the Toolset --- namely CamT E X (a Camila into L A T E X embedder) and Pretty (a L A T E X output Camila pretty printer) --- can be used in order to produce documentation in an integrated fashion.  1.  The bams. cam Prototype Camila prototype bams. cam is listed in Appendix D. 1.  Demo step 1.  At Unix shell level type camila bams. cam in order to start the animation of the prototype.  1. 1 The Specification This is the first section of the prototype.  It presents the animation of the formal specification of a toy "bank account management system" (BAMS).  This is really a very simple specification example based on the following abstract syntax: BAMS = AccId ,! Account Account = H : 2 AccHolder \Theta B : Amount AccId = STR AccHolder = STR Amount = INT (1. 1) 1 Sets's URL is http://www. di.
