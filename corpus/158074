Accuracy vs
 Simplicity: A Complex Trade-Off #.  Abstract Inductive learning aims at finding general rules that hold true in a database.  Targeted learning seeks rules for the prediction of the value of a variable based on the values of others, as in the case of linear or non-parametric regression analysis.  Non-targeted learning finds regularities without a specific prediction goal.  We model the product of non-targeted learning as rules that state that a certain phenomenon never happens, or that certain conditions necessitate another.  For all types of rules, there is a trade-off between the rule's accuracy and its simplicity.  Thus rule selection can be viewed as a choice problem, among pairs of degree of accuracy and degree of complexity.  However, one cannot in general tell what is the feasible set in the accuracycomplexity space.  Formally, we show that finding out whether a point belongs to this set is computationally hard.  In particular, in the context of linear regression, finding a small set of variables that obtain a certain value of R 2 is computationally hard.  Computational complexity may explain why a person is not always aware of rules that, if # Earlier versions of this
