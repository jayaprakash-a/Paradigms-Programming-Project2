How Much Of A Hypertree Can Be Captured By Windmills?
 Abstract Current approximation algorithms for maximum weight hypertrees find heavy windmill farms, and are based on the fact that a constant ratio (for constant width k) of the weight of a k-hypertree can be captured by a k-windmill farm.  However, the exact worst case ratio is not known and is only bounded to be between 1/(k + 1)! and 1/(k + 1).  We investigate this worst case ratio by searching for weighted hypertrees that minimize the ratio of their weight that can be captured with a windmill farm.  To do so, we use a novel approach in which a linear program is used to find "bad" inputs to a dynamic program.
