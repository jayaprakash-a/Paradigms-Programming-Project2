Recognition of Human Gaits
 Abstract We pose the problem of recognizing different types of human gait in the space of dynamical systems where each gait is represented.  Established techniques are employed to track a kinematic model of a human body in motion, and the trajectories of the parameters are used to learn a representation of a dynamical system, which defines a gait.  Various types of distance between models are then computed.  These computations are non trivial due to the fact that, even for the case of linear systems, the space of canonical realizations is not linear.
