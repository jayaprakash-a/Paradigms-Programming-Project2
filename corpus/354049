Approximation Schemes for Minimizing Average Weighted Completion Time with Release Dates
 Abstract We consider the problem of scheduling n jobs with release dates on m machines so as to minimize their average weighted completion time.  We present the first known polynomial time approximation schemes for several variants of this problem.  Our results include PTASs for the case of identical parallel machines and a constant number of unrelated machines with and without preemption allowed.  Our schemes are efficient: for all variants the running time for a (1 + ffl) approximation is of the form f(1=ffl; m)poly(n).
