Fast Multi-view Face Detection
 Abstract This paper extends the face detection framework proposed by Viola and Jones 2001 to handle profile views and rotated faces.  As in the work of Rowley et al 1998.  and Schneiderman et al.  2000, we build different detectors for different views of the face.  A decision tree is then trained to determine the viewpoint class (such as right profile or rotated 60 degrees) for a given window of the image being examined.  This is similar to the approach of Rowley et al.  1998.  The appropriate detector for that viewpoint can then be run instead of running all detectors on all windows.  This technique yields good results and maintains the speed advantage of the Viola-Jones detector.
