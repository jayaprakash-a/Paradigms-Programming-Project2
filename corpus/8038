Decision-Theoretic Bidding Based on Learned Density Models in Simultaneous, Interacting Auctions
 Abstract Auctions are becoming an increasingly popular method for transacting business, especially over the Internet.  This article presents a general approach to building autonomous bidding agents to bid in multiple simultaneous auctions for interacting goods.  A core component of our approach learns a model of the empirical price dynamics based on past data and uses the model to analytically calculate, to the greatest extent possible, optimal bids.  We introduce a new and general boosting-based algorithm for conditional density estimation problems of this kind, i. e. , supervised learning problems in which the goal is to estimate the entire conditional distribution of the real-valued label.  This approach is fully implemented as ATTac-2001, a top-scoring agent in the second Trading Agent Competition (TAC-01).  We present experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our boosting-based price predictor relative to several reasonable alternatives.
