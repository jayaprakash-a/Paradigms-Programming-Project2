Phaselets of Framelets
 Abstract Phaselets are a set of dyadic wavelets that are related in a particular way such that the associated redundant wavelet transform is nearly shift-invariant [1].  Framelets are a set of functions that generalize the notion of a single dyadic wavelet in the sense that dyadic dilates and translates of these functions form a frame in L 2 (IR) [2].  This paper generalizes the notion of phaselets to framelets.  Sets of framelets that only dier in their Fourier transform phase are constructed such that the resulting redundant wavelet transform is approximately shift-invariant.  Explicit constructions of phaselets are given for frames with two and three framelet generators.  The results in this paper generalize the construction of Hilbert transform pairs of framelets [3].
