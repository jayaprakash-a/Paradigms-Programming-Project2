A Sufficient Condition for Polynomial Distribution-dependent Learnability
 Abstract We investigate upper bounds on the sample-size sufficient for `solid' learnability with respect to a probability distribution.  We obtain a sufficient condition for feasible (polynomially bounded) sample-size bounds for distributionspecific (solid) learnability.
