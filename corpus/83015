Improved prediction of the number of residue contacts in proteins by recurrent neural networks
 Abstract Knowing the number of residue contacts in a protein is crucial for deriving constraints useful in modeling protein folding, protein structure, and/or scoring remote homology searches.  Here we use an ensemble of bi-directional recurrentneural network architectures and evolutionary information to improve the state-of-the-art in contact prediction using a large corpus of curated data.  The ensemble is used to discriminate between two different states of residue contacts, characterized by a contact number higher or lower than the average value of the residue distribution.  The ensemble achieves performances ranging from 70. 1% to 73. 1% depending on the radius adopted to discriminate contacts (6 A to 12 A).  These performances represent gains of 15% to 20% over the base line statistical predictors always assigning an aminoacid to the most numerous state, 3% to 7% better than any previous method.  Combination of different radius predictors further improves the performance.
