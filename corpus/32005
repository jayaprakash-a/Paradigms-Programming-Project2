A structure preserving image transformation as the goal of visual sensory coding
 Abstract Neuronal selectivity is often characterized by stimuli that evoke maximal responses.  But early in the visual system neurons are known to respond to a richer class of stimuli than it can be expected by a feed-forward architecture.  To explain this finding we present a more general functional framework for the exploration of neuronal responses.  To quantify the structure or 'interestingness' of an image patch we introduce a measure of the symmetries that can be found in image patches at the size of local receptive fields of cortical neurons.  We show how this transformation can explain strong responses to complex stimuli as well as responses to simple grating stimuli as found for neurons in V1 and V2.
