Modeling Interference Effects In Instructed Category Learning
 Abstract Category learning is often seen as a process of inductive generalization from a set of class-labeled exemplars.  Human learners, however, often receive direct instruction concerning the structure of a category before being presented with examples.  Such explicit knowledge may often be smoothly integrated with knowledge garnered by exposure to instances, but some interference effects have been observed.
