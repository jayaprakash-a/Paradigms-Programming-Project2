Probability Propagation and Iterative Decoding
 Abstract In this paper, we present a unified graphical model framework for describing codes and deriving iterative decoding algorithms.  We illustrate how the following systems can be described using graphical models: turbo-codes, seriallyconcatenated convolutional codes, frame-oriented turbo-codes, low-density paritycheck codes, product codes, and convolutional codes on channels with memory.  Recently proposed iterative decoding algorithms (e. g. , turbo-decoding) can be viewed as a simple message passing procedure on the graphical model.  This framework provides the means to derive new iterative decoders for new codes quite easily.
