Continuous Drifting Games
 Abstract We combine the results of [13] and [8] and derive a continuous variant of a large class of drifting games.  Our analysis furthers the understanding of the relationship between boosting, drifting games and Brownian motion and yields a differential equation that describes the core of the problem.
