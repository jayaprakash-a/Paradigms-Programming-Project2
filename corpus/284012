Browsing through High Quality Document Images with DjVu
 Abstract We present a new image compression technique called "DjVu " that is specifically geared towards the compression of high-resolution, high-quality images of scanned documents in color.  With DjVu , any screen connected to the Internet can access and display images of scannedpages while faithfully reproducing the font, color, drawing, pictures, and paper texture.  A typical magazine page in color at 300dpi can becompressed down to between 40 to 60 KB, approximately 5 to 10 times better than JPEG for a similar level of subjective quality.  B&W documents are typically 15 to 30 KBytes at 300dpi, or 4 to 8 times better than CCITT-G4.  Areal-time, memory efficient version of the decoder was implemented, and is available as a plug-in for popular web browsers.
