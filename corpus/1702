Silicon retina sensing guided by omni-directional vision
 Abstract: A way of combining a relatively new sensor-technology, that is optical analog VLSI devices, with a standard digital omni-directional vision system is investigated.  The sensor used is a neuromorphic analog VLSI sensor that estimates the global visual image motion.  The sensor provides two analog output voltages that represent the components of the global optical flow vector.  The readout is guided by an omni-directional mirror that maps the location of the ball and directs the robot to align its position so that a sensor-actuator module that includes the analog VLSI optical flow sensor can be activated.  The purpose of the sensoractuator module is to operate with a higher update rate than the standard vision system and thus increase the reactivity of the robot for very specific situations.  This paper will demonstrate an application example where the robot is a goalkeeper with the task of defending the goal during a penalty kick.
