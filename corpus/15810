Adaptive AIMD congestion control
 Abstract The main objectives of a congestion control algorithm are high bandwidth utilization, fairness and responsiveness in changing environment.  However, these objectives are contradicting in particular situations since the algorithm has to constantly probe available bandwidth, which may affect its stability.  This paper proposes a novel congestion control algorithm that achieves high bandwidth utilization providing fairness among competing connections and, on the other hand, is sufficiently responsive to changes of available bandwidth.  The main idea of the algorithm is to use adaptive setting for the Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) congestion control scheme, where parameters may change dynamically, with respect to the current network conditions.
