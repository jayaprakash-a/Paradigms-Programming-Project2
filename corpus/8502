Operant behavior suggests attentional gating of dopamine system inputs
 Abstract Neurophysiological recording experiments in the dopamine system by Schultz and colleagues (Science 275 (1997) 1593}1598) suggest that neurons there are involved in learning to predict rewards and assess behaviors using the temporal-di!erence algorithm.  One aspect o this theory which is undeveloped and experimentally underconstrained is its assumption o an exhaustive input representing all stimuli and their history over time.  We use the algorithm to model operant choice between concurrent variable interval schedules*a key animal conditioning experiment*and show that animals' subtly suboptimal per ormance resembles the behavior o the algorithm with a more limited input representation.  This limitation may reflect the operation o an attentional mechanism gating the inputs to the dopamine system.
