Auditory Feedback of Human EEG for Direct Brain-Computer Communication
 ABSTRACT The Thought-Translation-Device (TTD) is a Brain-ComputerInterface (BCI) that enables completely paralyzed patients to communicate by the use of their brain signals only.  Selfregulation of brain signals (e. g.  the slow cortical potentials) is achieved by a feedback training.  Visual impairment of these patients asks for an auditory feedback mode.  The TTD can be entirely operated by combined listening and mental activity.  It provides auditory feedback of brain signals which can operate a verbal spelling interface.  The extension POSER allows for sonified orchestral real-time feedback of multiple EEG parameters for the training of self-regulation.  The properties of the system are reported and the results of some studies and experiments with auditory feedback are presented.
