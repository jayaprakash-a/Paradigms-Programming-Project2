THE SIZE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL SOLUTIONS OF CONSECUTIVE PELL EQUATIONS
 Abstract.  Let D be a positive integer such that D; D\Gamma 1 are not perfect squares; denote by X 0 ; Y 0 ; X 1 ; Y 1 the least positive integers such that X 2 0 \Gamma (D \Gamma 1)Y 2 0 = 1; X 2 1 \Gamma DY 2 1 = 1; and put ae(D) = log X 1 = log X 0 : We prove here that ae(D) can be arbitrarily large.  Indeed, we exhibit an infinite family of values of D for which ae(D) AE D 1=6 = log D: We also provide some heuristic reasoning which suggests that there exists an infinitude of values of D for which ae(D) AE p D log log D= log D; and that this is the best possible result under the Extended Riemann Hypothesis.  Finally, we present some numerical evidence in support of this heuristic.
