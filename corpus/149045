Kernel Methods for Implicit Surface Modeling
 Abstract We describe methods for computing an implicit model of a hypersurface that is given only by a finite sampling.  The methods work by mapping the sample points into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then determining regions in terms of hyperplanes.
