Distributional Word Clusters vs
 Words for Text Categorization.  Abstract We study an approach to text categorization that combines distributional clustering of words and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.  This word-cluster representation is computed using the recently introduced Information Bottleneck method, which generates a compact and efficient representation of documents.  When combined with the classification power of the SVM, this method yields high performance in text categorization.  This novel combination of SVM with word-cluster representation is compared with SVM-based categorization using the simpler bag-of-words (BOW) representation.  The comparison is performed over three known datasets.  On one of these datasets (the 20 Newsgroups) the method based on word clusters significantly outperforms the word-based representation in terms of categorization accuracy or representation efficiency.  On the two other sets (Reuters-21578 and WebKB) the word-based representation slightly outperforms the word-cluster representation.  We investigate the potential reasons for this behavior and relate it to structural differences between the datasets.
