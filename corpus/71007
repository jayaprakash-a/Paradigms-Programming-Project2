Microscopy image analysis of bread using machine learning methods
 Abstract We studied the link between the bread microstructure and sensory properties using machine learning methods.  In the first phase, we extracted starch gelatinization degree and protein mesh properties from microscopy images.  Color histograms and Haralick features were found to be suitable feature extraction techniques.  In both cases, the prediction error of an induced model tree was lower than the standard deviation between independent predictions given by domain experts.  Combining models by boosting gave small gains in accuracy.  In the second phase, we used various analysis-originating attributes to predict bread sensory properties.  Best single attribute predictors and best pairs are reported.
