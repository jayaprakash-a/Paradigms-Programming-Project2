Uncoupled variational formulation of a vector Poisson problem
 Abstract -- This Note provides a rigorous analysis for the vector Poisson problem with the tangential component(s) of the unknown prescribed on the boundary together with the divergence of the unknown specified on it.  This kind of boundary conditions implies a coupling between the Cartesian components of the unknown in two and three dimensions.  A new uncoupled variational formulation of the problem is presented which is the basis of the influence matrix uncoupling method proposed by Quartapelle and Muzzio [7] and which leads to an alternative finite element solution method.
