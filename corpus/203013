 Abstract We have searched for decays of the lepton into seven or more charged particles, using data collected with the OPAL detector from 1990 to 1995 in e + e\Gamma collisions at p s MZ .  No candidate events were found and an upper limit on the branching ratio for decays into seven charged particles of 1:8 \Theta 10\Gamma 5 at the 95% confidence level was determined.
