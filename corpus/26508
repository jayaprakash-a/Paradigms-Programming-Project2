Analog VLSI Model of Locust DCMD Neuron Response for Computation of Object Approach
 In this paper, we present an analog VLSI (aVLSI) architecture that implements a functional model of the locust descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) neuron, based on recently published results.  We describe its architecture and analog circuits that implement its critical computational modules.  We also provide an analytical closed-form solution for some of the circuits proposed and verify the validity of our analysis both through circuit simulations and experimental data obtained from an aVLSI test chip.  This work shows that the circuits here proposed can be used to build hardware devices to model DCMD response curves.  Having complete control over the hardware system, neurophysiologists would then be able to measure in real time properties of looming stimuli and outcome of the neuromorphic model, while simultaneously performing the experiment on the real biological system.
