Support-Vector Networks
 Abstract.  The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems.  The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space.  In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed.  Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine.  The idea behind the supportvector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors.  We here extend this result to non-separable training data.  High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated.  We also compare the performance of the supportvector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.
