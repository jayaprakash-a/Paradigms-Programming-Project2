Temporal Response Field Characterization by Dynamic Ripple Spectra
 Abstract To understand the neural representation of broadband, dynamic sounds in Primary Auditory Cortex (AI), we characterize responses using the Spectro-Temporal Response Field (STRF).  The STRF describes, predicts and fully characterizes the linear dynamics of neurons in response to sounds with rich spectro-temporal envelopes.  It is computed from the responses to elementary `ripples,' a family of sounds with drifting, sinusoidal, spectral envelopes.  The collection of responses to all elementary ripples is the spectro-temporal transfer function.  The complex spectro-temporal envelope of any broadband, dynamic sound can expressed as the linear sum of individual ripples.  Previous experiments using ripples with downward drifting spectra suggested that the transfer function is separable, i. e. , it is reducible into a product of purely temporal and purely spectral functions.  Here we measure the responses to upward and downward drifting ripples, assuming separability within each direction, to determine if the total bi-directional transfer function is fully separable.  In general, the combined transfer function for two directions is not symmetric, and hence units in AI are not, in general, fully separable.  Consequently, many AI units have complex response properties such as sensitivity to direction of motion, though most inseparable units are not strongly directionally selective.  We show that for most neurons the lack of full separability stems from differences between the upward and downward spectral cross-sections, but not from the temporal cross-sections, which places strong constraints on the neural inputs of these AI units.
