Another Neural Code?
 This paper presents the conjecture that functional integration may be mediated by the mutual induction and maintenance of stereotyped spatiotemporal patterns of activity (i. e. , transients) in different neuronal populations.  In contradistinction to temporal and rate coding models of neuronal interactions, transient coding considers that transactions among neuronal systems use transient dynamics that are distributed in a structured way over both space and time.  In contrast to synchronization models, transient coding does not depend on interactions at the same frequencies, in different parts of the brain, but involves covariations among different frequencies and can therefore be considered a more general form of coding.  Using an analysis of the correlations among the spectral density of neuromagnetic signals, measured at different cortical regions, this hypothesis was confirmed.  For example high (gamma)-frequency oscillations in the prefrontal cortex are associated with low (20 Hz)-frequency oscillations in the parietal cortex.  The results are consistent with transient coding and suggest that transient dynamics endure for at least 40--200 ms.  Transient coding means that correlations (rate coding) and coherence (synchrony) are neither complete nor sufficient characterizations of neuronal interactions.  Although temporal coding, rate coding, and synchrony are important aspects of neuronal interactions, the results speak to further integrative neuronal mechanisms of a more general nature.  r 1997 Academic Press
