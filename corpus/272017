Layered Dynamic Textures
 Abstract A dynamic texture is a video model that treats a video as a sample from a spatio-temporal stochastic process, specifically a linear dynamical system.  One problem associated with the dynamic texture is that it cannot model video where there are multiple regions of distinct motion.  In this work, we introduce the layered dynamic texture model, which addresses this problem.  We also introduce a variant of the model, and present the EM algorithm for learning each of the models.  Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model for the tasks of segmentation and synthesis of video.
