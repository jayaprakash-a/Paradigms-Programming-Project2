Detecting Pedestrians Using Patterns of Motion and Appearance
 Abstract This paper describes a pedestrian detection system that integrates image intensity information with motion information.  We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence.  The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person.  Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector.  The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20x15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.  Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones.  Novel contributions of this paper include: i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow).
