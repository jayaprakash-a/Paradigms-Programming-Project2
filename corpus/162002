Predicting Time Series with Support Vector Machines
 Abstract.  Support Vector Machines are used for time series prediction and compared to radial basis function networks.  We make use of two different cost functions for Support Vectors: training with (i) an ffl insensitive loss and (ii) Huber's robust loss function and discuss how to choose the regularization parameters in these models.  Two applications are considered: data from (a) a noisy (normal and uniform noise) Mackey Glass equation and (b) the Santa Fe competition (set D).  In both cases Support Vector Machines show an excellent performance.  In case (b) the Support Vector approach improves the best known result on the benchmark by a factor of 37%.
