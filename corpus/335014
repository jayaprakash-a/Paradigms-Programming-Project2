A Sparse Texture Representation Using Affine-Invariant Regions
 Abstract This paper introduces a texture representation suitable for recognizing images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint changes and nonrigid deformations.  At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine-invariant local patches is extracted from the image.  This spatial selection process permits the computation of characteristic scale and neighborhood shape for every texture element.  The proposed texture representation is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a collection of photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.
