Parse Selection on the Redwoods Corpus: 3rd Growth Results
 Abstract This report details experimental results of using stochastic disambiguation models for parsing sentences from the Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al. , 2002).  The goals of this paper are two-fold: (i) to report accuracy results on the more highly ambiguous latest version of the treebank, as compared to already published results achieved by the same stochastic models on a previous version of the corpus, and (ii) to present some newly developed models using features from the HPSG signs, as well as the MRS dependency graphs.
