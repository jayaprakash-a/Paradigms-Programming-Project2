A Multi-scale Generative Model for Animate Shapes and Parts
 Abstract This paper presents a multi-scale generative model for representing animate shapes and extracting meaningful parts of objects.  The model assumes that animate shapes (2D simple closed curves) are formed by a linear superposition of a number of shape bases.  These shape bases resemble the multi-scale Gabor bases in image pyramid representation, are well localized in both spatial and frequency domains, and form an over-complete dictionary.  This model is simpler than the popular Bspline representation since it does not engage a domain partition.  Thus it eliminates the interference between adjacent B-spline bases, and becomes a true linear additive model.  We pursue the bases by reconstructing the shape in a coarse-to-fine procedure through curve evolution.  These shape bases are further organized in a tree-structure where the bases in each subtree sum up to an intuitive part of the object.  To build probabilistic model for a class of objects, we propose a Markov random field model at each level of the tree representation to account for the spatial relationship between bases.  Thus the final model integrates a Markov tree (generative) model over scales and a Markov random field over space.  We adopt EM-type algorithm for learning the meaningful parts for a shape class, and show some results on shape synthesis.
