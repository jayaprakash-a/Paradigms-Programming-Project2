Seeing Beyond Occlusions (and other marvels of a finite lens aperture)
 Abstract We present a novel algorithm to reconstruct the geometry and photometry of a scene with occlusions from a collection of defocused images.  The presence of a finite lens aperture allows us to recover portions of the scene that would be occluded in a pin-hole projection, thus "uncovering" the occlusion.  We estimate the shape of each object (a surface, including the occluding boundaries), and its radiance (a positive function defined on the surface, including portions that are occluded by other objects).
