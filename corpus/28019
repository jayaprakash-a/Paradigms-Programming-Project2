A Dynamic Causal Modeling Study on Category Effects: Bottom--Up or Top--Down Mediation?
 Abstract & In this study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate whether object category effects in the occipital and temporal cortex are mediated by inputs from early visual cortex or parietal regions.  Resolving this issue may provide anatomical constraints on theories of category specificity--which make different assumptions about the underlying neurophysiology.  The data were acquired by Ishai, Ungerleider, Martin, Schouten,
