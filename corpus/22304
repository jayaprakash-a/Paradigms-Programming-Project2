MotifPrototyper: a Bayesian Profile Model for Motif Families
 Abstract In this paper, we address the problem of modeling generic features of structurally but not textually related DNA motifs, that is, motifs whose consensus sequences are entirely different, but nevertheless share "meta-sequence features" reflecting similarities in the DNA binding domains of their associated protein recognizers.  We present MotifPrototyper, a profile Bayesian model which can capture structural properties typical of particular families of motifs.  Each family corresponds to transcription regulatory proteins with similar types of structural signatures in their DNA binding domains.  We show how to train MotifPrototypers from biologically identified motifs categorized according to the TRANSFAC categorization of transcription factors, and present empirical results of motif classification, motif parameter estimation and de novo motif detection using the learned profile models.
