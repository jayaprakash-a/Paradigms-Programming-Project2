Gamma-oscillations support optimal retrieval in associative memories of two-compartment neurons
 Abstract Theoretical studies concerning iterative retrieval in conventional associative memories suggest that cortical gamma-oscillations may constitute sequences of fast associative processes each restricted to a single period.  By providing a rhythmic threshold modulation suppressing cells that are uncorrelated with a stimulus, interneurons significantly contribute to this process.  This hypothesis is tested in the present paper utilizing a network of two-compartment model neurons developed by Pinsky and Rinzel.  It is shown that gamma-oscillations can simultaneously support an optimal speed for single pattern retrieval, an optimal repetition frequency for consecutive retrieval processes, and a very high memory capacity.
