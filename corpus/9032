SPEAKER-ADAPTATION FOR HYBRID HMM-ANN CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
 ABSTRACT It is well known that recognition performance degrades significantly when moving from a speakerdependent to a speaker-independent system.  Traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) systems have successfully applied speaker-adaptation approaches to reduce this degradation.  In this paper we presentandevaluate some techniques for speaker-adaptation of a hybrid HMM-artificial neural network (ANN) continuous speech recognition system.  These techniques are applied to a well trained, speaker-independent, hybrid HMM-ANN system and the recognizer parameters are adapted to a new speaker through off-line procedures.  The techniques are evaluated on the DARPA RM corpus using varying amounts of adaptation material and different ANN architectures.  The results showthat speaker-adaptation within the hybrid framework can substantially improve system performance.
