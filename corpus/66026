WebSuite: A Tool Suite for Harnessing Web Data
 Abstract We present a system for searching, collecting, integrating and managing Web-resident data.  The system consists of tools, each providing a specific functionality aimed at solving one aspect of the complex task of using and managing Web data.  Each tool can be used in a stand-alone mode, in combination with the other tools, or even in conjunction with other systems.  Together, the tools offer a range of capabilities that overcome many of the limitations in existing systems for harnessing Web data.  The paper describes each tool, and possible ways of combining the tools.
