Q-Warping: Direct Computation of Quadratic Reference Surfaces
 Abstract We consider the problem of wrapping around an object, of which two views are available, a reference surface and recovering the resulting parametric flow using direct computations (via spatio-temporal derivatives).  The well known examples are affine flow models and 8-parameter flow models --- both describing a flow field of a planar reference surface.  We extend those classic flow models to deal with a Quadric reference surface and work out the explicit parametric form of the flow field.  As a result we derive a simple warping algorithm that maps between two views and leaves a residual flow proportional to the 3D deviation of the surfacefrom a virtual quadric surface.  The applications include
