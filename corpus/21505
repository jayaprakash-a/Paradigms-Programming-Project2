Q-Clustering
 Abstract We show that Queyranne's algorithm for minimizing symmetric submodular functions can be used for clustering with a variety of different objective functions.  Two criteria that we consider in this paper are the maximum separation criterion, and the minimum description length criterion.  The first criterion tries to maximize the minimum distance between elements of different clusters, and is inherently "discriminative".  We will show that we can compute optimal clusterings into k clusters for any given k in polynomial time for this criterion.  The second criterion seeks to minimize the description length of the clusters given a probabilistic generative model.  We show that we can compute the optimal partitioning into 2 clusters, and approximate partitioning into more clusters.  Our approach differs from previous approaches to this problem which are either ad-hoc (with no well-defined objective criterion), or are approximate (which cannot guarantee optimal clusterings with respect to the objective function).  We show that the algorithm can be extended to other criteria by presenting a modified objective function which can still be exactly optimized, while being less sensitive to outliers.  We present results on three data sets.
