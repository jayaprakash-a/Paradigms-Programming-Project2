Converting Informal Meta-data to VDM-SL: A Reverse Calculation Approach
 Introduction Enterprise competitiveness in the information age is very much dependent on the quality of the underlying information systems.  These provide crucial support to as important tasks as strategic business planning and decision support.  Information system quality is, in turn, highly dependent upon consistency and reliability of stored data.  However, it is hard to maintain the quality of fast-growing data in loosely structured information systems.  These very rapidly become infected with so-called "dirty" data, a problem nowadays identified under the data quality heading.  In the last few years, many companies around the world have spent large amounts of resources on process re-engineering encompassing both applications and data repositories, in order to face the growing interest in data mining [1], data warehouse [12] and Web marketing systems [25].  The authors are currently engaged in a R&D project (KARMA) which aims at addressing data-quality from a formal-method viewpoint.  This includes the adoption of formal techniques for meta-data representation and (reverse) calculation of data intensive applications.  The KARMA-consortium involves three software houses 1 which contribute to the project with their experience in large data purification contracts.
