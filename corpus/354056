Finding nearest neighbors in growth-restricted metrics
 ABSTRACT Most research on nearest neighbor algorithms in the literature has been focused on the Euclidean case.  In many practical search problems however, the underlying metric is non-Euclidean.  Nearest neighbor algorithms for general metric spaces are quite weak, which motivates a search for other classes of metric spaces that can be tractably searched.  In this paper, we develop an efficient dynamic data structure for nearest neighbor queries in growth-constrained metrics.  These metrics satisfy the property that for any point q and distance d the number of points within distance 2d of q is at most a constant factor larger than the number of points within distance d.  Spaces of this kind may occur in networking applications, such as the Internet or Peer-to-peer networks, and vector quantization applications, where feature vectors fall into low-dimensional manifolds within high-dimensional vector spaces.
