Dynamic Texture Segmentation
 Abstract We address the problem of segmenting a sequence of images of natural scenes into disjoint regions that are characterized by constant spatio-temporal statistics.  We model the spatio-temporal dynamics in each region by Gauss-Markov models, and infer the model parameters as well as the boundary of the regions in a variational optimization framework.  Numerical results demonstrate that -- in contrast to purely texture-based segmentation schemes -- our method is effective in segmenting regions that differ in their dynamics even when spatial statistics are identical.
