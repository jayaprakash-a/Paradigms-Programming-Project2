Silicon Baroreceptors: Modeling Cardiovascular Pressure Transduction in Analog VLSI
 Abstract This paper describes an analog VLSI model of the representation of blood pressure used in a neural control system in the cardiovascular system.  The chip computes the representation in real time, using analog continuoustime processing.  We apply a variety of pressure signals to the chip, confirming that the chip models known physiological responses.  We are modeling this representation as a first step to understanding the neural computation of cardiovascular control; we hope to apply this knowledge to nonlinear dynamical control problems in the chemical industry.
