Neural Network Models for the Blood Glucose Metabolism of a Diabetic
 Abstract We study the application of neural networks to modeling the blood glucose metabolism of a diabetic.  In particular we consider recurrent neural networks and time series convolution neural networks which we compare to linear models and to nonlinear compartment models.  We include a linear error model to take into account the uncertainty in the system and for handling missing blood glucose observations.  Our results indicate that best performance can be achieved by the combination of the recurrent neural network and the linear error model.
