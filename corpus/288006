A Practical Monte Carlo Implementation of Bayesian Learning
 Abstract A practical method for Bayesian training of feed-forward neural networks using sophisticated Monte Carlo methods is presented and evaluated.  In reasonably small amounts of computer time this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 5 datalimited tasks from real world domains.
