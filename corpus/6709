Inactivation and conformational changes of fatty acid synthase from chicken liver during unfolding by sodium dodecyl sulfate
 Abstract Fatty acid synthase is an important enzyme participating in energy metabolism in vivo.  The inactivation and conformational changes of the multifunctional fatty acid synthase from chicken liver in SDS solutions have been studied.  The results show that the denaturation of this multifunctional enzyme by SDS occurred in three stages.  At low concentrations of SDS (less than 0. 15 mM) the enzyme was completely inactivated with regard to the overall reaction.  For each component of the enzyme, the loss of activity occurred at higher concentrations of SDS.  Signicant conformational changes (as indicated by the changes of the intrinsic uorescence emission and the ultraviolet dierence spectra) occurred at higher concentrations of SDS.  Increasing the SDS concentration caused only slight changes of the CD spectra, indicating that SDS had no signicant eect on the secondary structure of the enzyme.  The results suggest that the active sites of the multifunctional fatty acid synthase display more conformational exibility than the enzyme molecule as a whole.
