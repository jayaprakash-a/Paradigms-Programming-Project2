CONSISTENCY OF INFOMAX ICA DECOMPOSITION OF FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING DATA
 ABSTRACT Ten spatial infomax ICA decompositions were performed on two fMRI data sets collected from the same subject.  The maximallyindependent spatial components were then tested across decompositions for one-to-one correspondences.  Matching independent component maps by mutual information alone proved ineffective.  Matching component map pairs by correlating their z-transformed voxel map weights demonstrated that the top 100 components were stably reproduced in each of the ten decompositions.  Infomax ICA therefore provided a stable decomposition of fMRI data into spatially independent components.
