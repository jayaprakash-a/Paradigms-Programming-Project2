Image Based Regression Using Boosting Method
 Abstract We present a general algorithm of image based regression that is applicable to many vision problems.  The proposed regressor that targets a multiple-output setting is learned using boosting method.  We formulate a multiple-output regression problem in such a way that overfitting is decreased and an analytic solution is admitted.  Because we represent the image via a set of highly redundant Haar-like features that can be evaluated very quickly and select relevant features through boosting to absorb the knowledge of the training data, during testing we require no storage of the training data and evaluate the regression function almost in no time.  We also propose an efficient training algorithm that breaks the computational bottleneck in the greedy feature selection process.  We validate the efficiency of the proposed regressor using three challenging tasks of age estimation, tumor detection, and endocardial wall localization and achieve the best performance with a dramatic speed, e. g. , more than 1000 times faster than conventional data-driven techniques such as support vector regressor in the experiment of endocardial wall localization.
