Developmental Embodied Cognition
 The objective of this workshop was to bring together researchers from cognitive science, psychology, robotics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, and related fields to discuss the role of developmental and embodied views of cognition, and in particular, their mutual relationship.  The ultimate goal of this approach is to understand the emergence of high-level cognition in organisms based on their interactions with their environment over extended periods of time.
