Nonlinear Feature Selection with the Potential Support Vector Machine
 SVM) which is a new filter method for feature selection.  The idea of the P-SVM feature selection is to exchange the role of features and data points in order to construct "support features".  The "support features" are the selected features.  The P-SVM uses a novel objective function and novel constraints -- one constraint for each feature.  As with standard SVMs, the objective function represents a complexity or capacity measure whereas the constraints enforce low empirical error.  In this contribution we extend the P-SVM in two directions.  First, we introduce a parameter which controls the redundancy among the selected features.  Secondly, we propose a nonlinear version of the P-SVM feature selection which is based on neural network techniques.  Finally, the linear and nonlinear P-SVM feature selection approach is demonstrated on toy data sets and on data sets from the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge.
