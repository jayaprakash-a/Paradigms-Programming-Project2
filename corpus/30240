Beauty Semileptonic Branching Ratios
 Abstract Recent measurements of inclusive and exclusive semileptonic b branching ratios are reviewed.  Model-independent analyses from ARGUS and CLEO confirm the value B(b ! `X) = 10:4%, while new analyses from ALEPH obtain higher values above 11%.  The difference is not consistent with measured values of b hadron lifetime.  New measurements of B(B ! D ? `) from CLEO and ALEPH are in good agreement.  First measurements of B ! D ? `branching ratios from OPAL, DELPHI, and ALEPH confirm indirect evidence for a large D ?? component in semileptonic B decays.
