SVM and Boosting: One Class
 Abstract We show via an equivalence of mathematical programs that a Support Vector (SV) algorithm can be translated into an equivalent boosting-like algorithm and vice versa.  We exemplify this translation procedure for a new algorithm --one-class Leveraging --- starting from the one-class Support Vector Machines (1SVM).  This is a first step towards unsupervised learning in a Boosting framework.  Building on so-called barrier methods known from the theory of constrained optimization, it returns a function, written as a convex combination of basis hypotheses, that characterizes whether a given test point is likely to have been generated from the distribution underlying the training data.  Simulations on one-class classification problems demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.
