Determination of the fluorescence quantum yield by oceanic phytoplankton in their natural habitat
 Sun-stimulated chlorophyll a fluorescence has been measured in situ, within the upward and downward light fields, in oceanic waters with chlorophyll concentrations of 0. 04 --3 mg m 23 .  We combined these signals with phytoplankton absorption spectra to derive the fluorescence quantum yield, f~number of photons emitted by fluorescenceynumber of absorbed photons!.  f was derived separately from hyperspectral ~upward and downward! irradiance measurements ~with a LI-COR Instruments spectroradiometer! and from nadir radiance near 683 nm ~with a Biospherical Instruments profiler!.  The contribution of inelastic Raman scattering to the signal in the red band was assessed and subtracted.  Ramancorrected f values derived from the two instruments compared well.  Vertical f profiles were strongly structured, with maximal ~5-- 6%! values at depth, whereas f was }1% in near-surface waters ~measurements made approximately at solar noon!.  These near-surface values are needed for interpretation of remotely sensed fluorescence signals.  This optical study shows that the fluorescence yield of algae in their natural environment can be accurately derived in a nonintrusive way with available instrumentation and adequate protocols.  2000 Optical Society of America
