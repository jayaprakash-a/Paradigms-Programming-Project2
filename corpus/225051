Is it Harder to Parse Chinese, or the Chinese Treebank?
 Abstract We present a detailed investigation of the challenges posed when applying parsing models developed against English corpora to Chinese.  We develop a factored-model statistical parser for the Penn Chinese Treebank, showing the implications of gross statistical differences between WSJ and Chinese Treebanks for the most general methods of parser adaptation.  We then provide a detailed analysis of the major sources of statistical parse errors for this corpus, showing their causes and relative frequencies, and show that while some types of errors are due to dicult ambiguities inherent in Chinese grammar, others arise due to treebank annotation practices.  We show how each type of error can be addressed with simple, targeted changes to the independence assumptions of the maximum likelihood-estimated PCFG factor of the parsing model, which raises our F1 from 80. 7% to 82. 6% on our development set, and achieves parse accuracy close to the best published figures for Chinese parsing.  1 Background Even narrow-coverage context-free natural language grammars produce explosive ambiguity (Church and Patil, 1982).  Today's treebankderived broad-coverage CFGs generate even more, some of it genuine linguistic ambiguity and some of it artificial (see (Krotov et al. , 1998) and (Johnson, 1998) for discussion).  Corpusbased statistical parsing is a leading technique to deal with this extreme ambiguity; the vast bulk of work in this field has been done in English, using the Wall Street Journal section of the English Penn Treebank (ETB).  State-ofthe-art statistical parsing techniques now handle most ambiguity adequately; the best statistical parsers for the ETB are now at roughly 90% labeled bracketing accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000).  The remaining dicult-toresolve ambiguities are fairly well-understood for English
