The Linear Programming Approach to Approximate Dynamic Programming
 Abstract The curse of dimensionality gives rise to prohibitive computational requirements that render infeasible the exact solution of large-scale stochastic control problems.  We study an ecient method based on linear programming for approximating solutions to such problems.  The approach \#ts" a linear combination of pre-selected basis functions to the dynamic programming cost-to-go function.  Wedevelop error bounds that offer performance guarantees and also guide the selection of both basis functions and \state-relevance weights" that influence quality of the approximation.  Experimental results in the domain of queueing network control provide empirical support for the methodology.
