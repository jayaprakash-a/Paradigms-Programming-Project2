SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL THEORIES OF
 Abstract This paper describes a visual object detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates.  There are three key contributions.  The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly.  The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [6].  The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions.  A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented.  The system yields face detection performace comparable to the best previous systems [18, 13, 16, 12, 1].  Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.
