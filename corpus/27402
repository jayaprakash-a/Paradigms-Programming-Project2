Efficient Estimation exploiting Independence Constraints
 Abstract There is an obvious way to obtain an unbiased estimate of the response to a query P ( C = c j E= e ) from a sufficiently large data sample: just use the empirical frequency.  Unfortunately, this can have high variance (or even be undefined) when the conditioning event E = e is rare.  In some situations, we are able to reduce this variance by exploiting our knowledge about the underlying distribution --- in particular, by using a known set of probabilistic indepedencies amongst the variables, encoded in the structure of a Bayesian belief network.  The report investigates ways to exploit those independencies when estimating the response to a probabilistic query.  In particular, we show a general approach that produces an unbiased estimate with small variance.  Of independent interest, we also present a closed form expression for the (asymptotic) variance of a response wrt a given structure and sample.
