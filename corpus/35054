Learning Algorithms for Networks with Internal and External Feedback
 the inputs have to remain stationary are considered to be static algorithms, although the settling process is a dynamic one based on internal feedback.  If a given network type can be employed for dynamic problems, and if there exists a corresponding learning algorithm, then we sometimes speak of a dynamic network.  The credit assignment problem.  If a neural network is supposed to learn externally posed tasks then it faces Minsky's fundamental credit assignment problem: If performance is not sufficient, then which component of the network at which time did in which way contribute to the failure? How should critical components change behavior to increase future performance?
