Maintaining Multiple Motion Model Hypotheses Through Many Views to Recover Matching and Structure
 Abstract In order to recover structure from images it is desirable to use many views to obtain the best possible estimates.  However, whilst recovering projective structure and motion from such extended sequences problems arise that are not apparent from a general viewpoint/structure approach.  Foremost amongst these are (a) maintaining image correspondences consistently through many images, and (b) identifying images, within the sequence, for which structure cannot be reliably recovery.  Within this paper the use of multiple motion model hypotheses is explored as an aid to solve both of these problems.
