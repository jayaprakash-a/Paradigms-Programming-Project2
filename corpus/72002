Comparing Subspace Clusterings
 Abstract We present the first attempt at designing a framework for comparing subspace clusterings.  We propose several subspace clustering distance measures, including generalizations of well-known distance measures for ordinary clusterings.  We describe a set of desirable properties for any measure for comparing subspace clusterings, as well as a systematic comparison of our proposed measures in terms of these properties.  We validate the usefulness of our subspace clustering distance measures by comparing clusterings produced by the algorithms FastDOC, HARP, PROCLUS, ORCLUS, and SSPC.
