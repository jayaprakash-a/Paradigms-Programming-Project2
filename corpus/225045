Interpreting and Extending Classical Agglomerative Clustering Algorithms using a Model-Based approach
 Abstract We present two results which arise from a model-based approach to hierarchical agglomerative clustering.  First, we show formally that the common heuristic agglomerative clustering algorithms -- Ward's method, single-link, complete-link, and a variant of group-average -are each equivalent to a hierarchical model-based method.  This interpretation gives a theoretical explanation of the empirical behavior of these algorithms, as well as a principled approach to resolving practical issues, such as number of clusters or the choice of method.  Second, we show how a model-based viewpoint can suggest variations on these basic agglomerative algorithms.  We introduce adjusted complete-link, Mahalanobis-link, and line-link as variants, and demonstrate their utility.
