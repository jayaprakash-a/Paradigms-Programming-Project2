DIGIT RECOGNITION IN NOISY ENVIRONMENTS VIA A SEQUENTIAL GMM/SVM SYSTEM
 ABSTRACT This paper exploits the fact that when GMM and SVM classifiers with roughly the same level of performance exhibit uncorrelated errors they can be combined to produce a better classifier.  The gain accrues from combining the descriptive strength of GMM models with the discriminative power of SVM classifiers.  This idea, first exploited in the context of speaker recognition [1, 2], is applied to speech recognition - specifically to a digit recognition task in a noisy environment - with significant gains in performance.
