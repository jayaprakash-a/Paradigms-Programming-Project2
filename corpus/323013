Spatial Knowledge in Humans, Animals and Robots
 Abstract Humans, animals and robots are physically existing agents situated in the real world.  Their common ability to extract, store and use spatial information is crucial for their successful operation.  On the other hand, their idiosyncracies seem to be reflected on their spatial knowledge.  The paper attempts a discussion around the cognitive map, a term coined to describe exactly the body of spatial knowledge held by an agent.  The topic is discussed at both a global and an individual level, occasionally interleaved with the author's personal opinions.
