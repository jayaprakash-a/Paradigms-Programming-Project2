Alternative Essences of Intelligence
 Abstract We present a novel methodology for building humanlike artificially intelligent systems.  We take as a model the only existing systems which are universally accepted as intelligent: humans.  We emphasize building intelligent systems which are not masters of a single domain, but, like humans, are adept at performing a variety of complex tasks in the real world.  Using evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience, we suggest alternative "essences of intelligence" to those held by classical AI: the parallel themes of development, social interaction, embodiment, and integration.  Following a methodology based on these themes, we have built a physical humanoid robot.  In this paper we present our methodology and the insights it affords for facilitating learning, simplifying the computation underlying rich behavior, and building systems that can scale to more complex tasks in more challenging environments.
