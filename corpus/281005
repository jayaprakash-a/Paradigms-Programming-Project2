Application of the Variational Bayesian Approach to Speech Recognition
 Abstract In this paper, we propose a method based on the variational Bayesian (VB) approach, for training shared-state triphone HMMs (SST-HMMs) for robust speech recognition.  An appropriate model structure with high recognition performance can be found within the VB framework.  Unlike conventional methods including BIC or MDL criterion based on the maximum likelihood approach, the proposed model selection is valid in principle, even in the case of insufficient amounts of data, because it does not use an asymptotic assumption.  In isolated word recognition experiments, we show the advantage of the proposed method over conventional methods, especially when dealing with small amounts of data.
