Syntax-Based Alignment: Supervised or Unsupervised?
 Abstract Tree-based approaches to alignment model translation as a sequence of probabilistic operations transforming the syntactic parse tree of a sentence in one language into that of the other.  The trees may be learned directly from parallel corpora (Wu, 1997), or provided by a parser trained on hand-annotated treebanks (Yamada and Knight, 2001).  In this paper, we compare these approaches on Chinese-English and French-English datasets, and find that automatically derived trees result in better agreement with human-annotated word-level alignments for unseen test data.
