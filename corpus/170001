Stochastic simulation of ants that forage by expectation
 Abstract Stochastic simulation has been used to create an artificial colony of ants in order to study ant foraging strategies and the links between individual activity and the colony's self-organised behaviour.  The ants, which forage by expectation, use a deterministic mathematical model developed by Ollason (1980, Theor.  Pop.  Biol.
