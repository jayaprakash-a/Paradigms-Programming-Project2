Probabilistic Tracking with Exemplars in a Metric Space
 Abstract.  A new, exemplar-based, probabilistic paradigm for visual tracking is presented.  Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner.  Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations.  Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models, and problems with changes of topology.  Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the "Metric Mixture" (M 2 ) approach, which has a number of attractions.  Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space.  Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data.  Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M 2 model in two domains: tracking walking people using "chamfer" distances on binary edge images, and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance.
