Object Recognition using the Invariant Pixel-Set Signature
 Abstract A new object recognition method, the Invariant Pixel Set Signature (IPSS), is introduced.  Objects are represented with a probability density on the space of invariants computed from measurements (pixel values) inside convex hulls of n-tuples of interest points.  Experimentally the method is tested on COIL-20, a publicly available database of 72 views of 20 natural object rotating on a turntable.  With a model built from a single view, recognition performance measured by the average match percentile is above 98% for #20 degrees and above 96% for #30 degrees.  For some object, 100% first rank is achieved for all 72 views.  Robustness to occlusion is shown using images with one half covered.  For a small change of viewpoint (#10 degrees) recognition of the occluded object is perfect.
