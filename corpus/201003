Geometry in Learning
 Abstract One of the fundamental problems in learning is identifying members of two different classes.  For example, to diagnose cancer, one must learn to discriminate between benign and malignant tumors.  Through examination of tumors with previously determined diagnosis, one learns some function for distinguishing the benign and malignant tumors.  Then the acquired knowledge is used to diagnose new tumors.  The perceptron is a simple biologically inspired model for this two-class learning problem.  The perceptron is trained or constructed using examples from the two classes.  Then the perceptron is used to classify new examples.  We describe geometrically what a perceptron is capable of learning.  Using duality, we develop a framework for investigating different methods of training a perceptron.  Depending on how we define the "best" perceptron, different minimization problems are developed for training the perceptron.  The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated empirically on four practical applications: breast cancer diagnosis, detection of heart disease, political voting habits, and sonar recognition.  This paper does not assume prior knowledge of machine learning or pattern recognition.
