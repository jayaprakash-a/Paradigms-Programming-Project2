Automatic Analysis of Multimodal Group Actions in Meetings
 Abstract.  This paper investigates the recognition of group actions in meetings.  A statistical framework is proposed in which group actions result from the interactions of the individual participants.  The group actions are modelled using dierent HMM-based approaches, where the observations are provided by a set of audio-visual features monitoring the actions of individuals.  Experiments demonstrate the importance of taking interactions into account in modelling the group actions.  It is also shown that the visual modality contains useful information, even for predominantly audio-based events, motivating a multimodal approach to meeting analysis.
