Non-Perspective Imaging and Rendering with the Crossed-Slits Projection
 Abstract We describe a new family of projection models defined by two slits - the Crossed-Slits (XSlits) projection.  In this model the projection ray of every 3D point is defined by the line that passes through the point and intersects the two slits.  The intersection of these rays with the imaging surface defines the image.  Algebraically the X-Slits projection is a second-order transformation from 3-D to 2-D.  For our main application we show that new X-Slits images can be generated by straightforward mosaicing from a sequence of images captured by a translating pinhole camera.  This can be used for rendering movies of virtual walkthroughs from a single sequence of images very fast and very eciently, without recovering any 3-D geometry.  We show a number of examples where we move the camera around and change its orientation; the examples demonstrate realistic changes in parallax, reflections, and occlusions.  The second proposed application is 3-D object visualization.
