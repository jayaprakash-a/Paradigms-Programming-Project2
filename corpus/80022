Efficient Algorithms for Learning to Play Repeated Games Against Computationally Bounded Adversaries
 Abstract We study the problem of efficiently learning to play a game optimally against an unknown adversary chosen from a computationally bounded class.  We both contribute to the line of research on playing games against finite automata, and expand the scope of this research by considering new classes of adversaries.  We introduce the natural notions of games against recent history adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple boolean formula on the recent history of play), and games against statistical adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple function of the statistics of the entire history of play).  In both cases we give efficient algorithms for learning to play penny-matching and a more difficult game called contract .  We also give the most powerful positive result to date for learning to play against finite automata, an efficient algorithm for learning to play any game against any finite automata with probabilistic actions and low cover time.
