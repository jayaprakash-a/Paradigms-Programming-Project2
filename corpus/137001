Dynamic Across-Time Measurement Interpretation
 Abstract Incrementally maintaining a qualitative understanding of physical system behavior based on observations is crucial to tasks such as real-time control, monitoring, and diagnosis.  This paper describes the DATMI theory for interpretation tasks.  The key idea of DATMI is to dynamically maintain a concise representation of the space of local and global interpretations across time that are consistent with the observations.  This representation has two key advantages.  First, a set of possible interpretations is more useful than a single (best) candidate for many tasks, such as conservative monitoring.  Second, this representation simplifies switching to alternative interpretations when data are faulty or incomplete.  Domain-specific knowledge about state and transition probabilities can be used to suggest the interpretation which is most likely.  Domain-specific knowledge about durations of states and paths of states can also be used to further constrain the interpretation space.  When no consistent interpretation exists, faulty-data hypotheses are generated and then tested by adjusting the interpretation space.  The DATMI theory has been tested via implementation and we describe its performance on two examples.
