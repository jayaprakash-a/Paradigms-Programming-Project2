Hierarchical HMMs
 Abstract The hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) is a generalization of the hidden Markov model (HMM) that models sequences with structure at many length/time scales (Fine, Singer & Tishby, 1998).  Unfortunately, the original inference algorithm is rather complicated, and takes O(T 3 ) time, where T is the length of the sequence, making it impractical for many domains.  In this paper, we show how HHMMs are a special kind of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), and thereby derive a much simpler inference algorithm, which only takes O(T ) time.  We explain how to do parameter and structure learning, and discuss related models and applications.
