Independent Components Analysis For Step-Wise Separation of Signals
 Abstract We introduce a method for the step-wise extraction of each of N source signals from a set of M N signal mixtures.  The mixtures x = (x1 ; : : : ; xM ) T are formed by combining different proportions of the independent sources s = (s1 ; : : : ; sN ) T using an M \Theta N mixing matrix A, so that x = As.  Porrill and Stone [Porrill and Stone, 1997] showed that K N signals (s1 ; : : : ; sK ) T could be extracted using a K \Theta M rectangular un0mixing matrix W by maximising the joint entropy of K whitened, unmixed signals Y = oe(Wx), where oe is a monotonic, non-linear function.  Rather than extracting K N signals simultaneously, we use a step-wise procedure in which each step consists of extracting K = 1 source signal, and then subtracting that signal from the signal mixtures.  The relation between this ICA method and exploratory projection pursuit is discussed.  The method is demonstrated on acoustic data.
