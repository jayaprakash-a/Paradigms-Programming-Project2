 ABSTRACT Previously, we have demonstrated that feed-forward networks may be used to estimate local output probabilities in hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognition systems.  Here these connectionist techniques are integrated into the DECIPHER system, with experiments being performed using the speaker independent DARPA RM database.  Our results indicate that: .  connectionist probability estimation can improve performance of a context independent maximum likelihood trained HMM system, .  performance of the connectionist system is close to what can be achieved using (context dependent) HMM systems of much higher complexity, and .  mixing connectionist and maximum likelihood estimates can improve the performance of a state-of-theart context dependent HMM system.
