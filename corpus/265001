Orientation-Selective aVLSI Spiking Neurons
 Abstract We describe a programmable multi-chip VLSI neuronal system that can be used for exploring spike-based information processing models.  The system consists of a silicon retina, a PIC microcontroller, and a transceiver chip whose integrate-and-fire neurons are connected in a soft winner-take-all architecture.  The circuit on this multi-neuron chip approximates a cortical microcircuit.  The neurons can be configured for different computational properties by the virtual connections of a selected set of pixels on the silicon retina.  The virtual wiring between the different chips is effected by an event-driven communication protocol that uses asynchronous digital pulses, similar to spikes in a neuronal system.  We used the multi-chip spike-based system to synthesize orientation-tuned neurons using both a feedforward model and a feedback model.  The performance of our analog hardware spiking model matched the experimental observations and digital simulations of continuous-valued neurons.  The multi-chip VLSI system has advantages over computer neuronal models in that it is real-time, and the computational time does not scale with the size of the neuronal network.
