 ABSTRACT The maximum absolute value of integral weights sufficient to represent any linearly separable Boolean function is investigated.  It is shown that upper bounds exhibited by Muroga (1971) for rational weights satisfying the so-called normalized system of inequalities also hold for integral weights.  This improves previously known upper bounds.
