Computer Modeling, Analysis and Synthesis of Dressed Humans
 Abstract 1 In this paper we present a method for 3-D reconstruction of human bodies with application in CAD systems for garment design.  The reconstruction scheme uses image information from several arbitrary views and deformable superquadrics as the models of the body parts.  Two visual cues are used: occluding contours and stereo (possibly aided by projected patterns).  Our preliminary experiments show that the reconstruction is more complete than in purely stereo or structured light based methods and more precise than the reconstruction from occluding contours only.  From the reconstructed human body, the body measurements can be taken automatically, and used in garment design.  We give an example of draping of virtual garment over the photo-realistic 3D model of the imaged human.  One can easily envision the use of the described algorithms in the development of custom-fit garment retail software over the Internet, which would include the possibility of trying the garment on in virtual reality.
