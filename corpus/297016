Incremental Heuristic Search in Artificial Intelligence
 Overview It is often important that searches be fast.  Artificial intelligence has developed several ways of speeding up searches by trading off the search time and the cost of the resulting path.  This includes using inadmissible heuristics (Pohl 1970; Pohl 1973) and search with limited look-ahead (Korf 1990; Ishida and Korf 1991; Koenig 2001), which is also called real-time or agent-centered search.  In this article, we discuss a different way of speeding up searches, namely incremental search.  Incremental search is a search technique for continual planning (or, synonymously, replanning, plan reuse, and lifelong planning) that reuses information from previous searches to find solutions to a series of similar search problems potentially faster than is possible by solving each search problem from scratch.  Different from other ways of speeding up searches, it can guarantee to find shortest paths.  Notice that the terminology is unfortunately somewhat problematic since the term "incremental search" in computer science also refers to both on-line search and search with limited look-ahead (
