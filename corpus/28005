Brownian Motion on a Smash Line
 Abstract Brownian motion on a smash line algebra (a smash or braided version of the algebra resulting by tensoring the real line and the generalized paragrassmann line algebras), is constructed by means of its Hopf algebraic structure.  Further, statistical moments, non stationary generalizations and its diffusion limit are also studied.  The ensuing diffusion equation possesses triangular matrix realizations.
