A Multi-Agent Negotiation Testbed for Contracting Tasks with Temporal and Precedence Constraints
 Abstract We are interested in supporting multi-agent contracting, in which customer agents solicit the resources and capabilities of other, self-interested agents in order to accomplish their goals.  Goals may involve the execution of multi-step tasks, in which different tasks are contracted out to different suppliers.  We have developed a testbed that allows us to study decision behaviors of agents in this context.  It can generate sets of tasks with known statistical attributes, formulate and submit requests for quotations, generate bids with well-defined statistics, and evaluate those bids according to a number of criteria.  Each of these processes is supported by an abstract interface and a series of pluggable modules with a large number of configuration parameters, and with data collection and analysis tools.
