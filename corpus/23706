Interactive 3D Scene Reconstruction from Images
 Abstract We propose an interactive framework for reconstructing an arbitrary 3D scene consistent with a set of images, for use in example-based image synthesis.  Previous research has used human input to specify feature matches, which are then processed off-line; however, it is very difficult to correctly match images without feedback.  The central idea of this paper is to perform and display 3D reconstruction during user modification.  By allowing the user to interactively manipulate the image correspondence and the resulting 3D reconstruction, we can exploit both the user's intuitive image understanding and the computer's processing power.
