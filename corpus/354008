Arpeggio: Metadata Searching and Content Sharing with Chord
 Abstract Arpeggio is a peer-to-peer file-sharing network based on the Chord lookup primitive.  Queries for data whose metadata matches a certain criterion are performed efficiently by using a distributed keyword-set index, augmented with index-side filtering.  We introduce index gateways, a technique for minimizing index maintenance overhead.  Because file data is large, Arpeggio employs subrings to track live source peers without the cost of inserting the data itself into the network.  Finally, we introduce postfetching, a technique that uses information in the index to improve the availability of rare files.  The result is a system that provides efficient query operations with the scalability and reliability advantages of full decentralization, and a content distribution system tuned to the requirements and capabilities of a peer-to-peer network.  1 Overview and Related Work Peer-to-peer file sharing systems, which let users locate and obtain files shared by other users, have many advantages: they operate more efficiently than the traditional client-server model by utilizing peers' upload bandwidth, and can be implemented without a central server.  However, many current file sharing systems trade-off scalability for correctness, resulting in systems that scale well but sacrifice completeness of search results or vice-versa.  Distributed hash tables have become a standard for constructing peer-to-peer systems because they overcome the difficulties of quickly and correctly
