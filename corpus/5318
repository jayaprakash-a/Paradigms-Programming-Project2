Multiscale Annealing for Real-Time Unsupervised Texture Segmentation
 Abstract We derive real--time global optimization methods for several clustering optimization problems commonly used in unsupervised texture segmentation.  Speed is achieved by exploiting the image neighborhood relation of features to design a multiscale optimization technique, while accuracy and global optimization properties are gained using annealing techniques.  Coarse grained cost functions are derived for central and histogram--based clustering as well as several sparse proximity--based clustering methods.  The problem of coarsening sparse random graphs is solved by the concept of structured randomization.  For optimization deterministic annealing algorithms are applied.  Annealing schedule, coarse--to--fine optimization and the estimated number of segments are tightly coupled by a statistical convergence criterion derived from computational learning theory.  The notion of optimization scale introduced by a computational temperature is thus unified with the scales defined by image and object resolution.  The algorithms are benchmarked on Brodatz-like micro--texture mixtures.  Results are presented for an autonomous robotics application.  Extensions are discussed in the context of prestructuring large image databases which is necessary for fast and reliable image retrieval.
