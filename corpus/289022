Asymptotic Behaviors of Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernel
 Abstract Support vector machines (SVMs) with the Gaussian (RBF) kernel have been popular for practical use.  Model selection in this class of SVMs involves two hyperparameters: the penalty parameter C and the kernel width #.  This paper analyzes the behavior of the SVM classifier when these hyperparameters take very small or very large values.  Our results help in a good understanding of the hyperparameter space that leads to an ecient heuristic method of searching for hyperparameter values with small generalization errors.  The analysis also indicates that if complete model selection using the Gaussian kernel has been conducted, there is no need to consider linear SVM.
