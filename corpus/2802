Support Vector Machines for Multiple-Instance Learning
 Abstract This paper presents two new formulations of multiple-instance learning as a maximum margin problem.  The proposed extensions of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning approach lead to mixed integer quadratic programs that can be solved heuristically.  Our generalization of SVMs makes a state-of-the-art classification technique, including non-linear classification via kernels, available to an area that up to now has been largely dominated by special purpose methods.  We present experimental results on a pharmaceutical data set and on applications in automated image indexing and document categorization.
