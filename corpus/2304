Noise delays onset of sustained "ring in a minimal model of persistent activity
 Abstract We report a noise-induced delayof bifurcation leading to persistent synapticallysustained "ring in a simple neural circuit.  Two neural saddle-node oscillators are coupled with reciprocal excitatory synapses.  Increasing synaptic current moves the circuit through a bifurcation into a bistable anti-phase regime.  Applying a small random current to both neurons delays the onset of bistability.  We analyse the phase plane for the various activity regimes and "nd that this noise induced mechansim can be related to the structure of asynchronous and synchronous activity states.
