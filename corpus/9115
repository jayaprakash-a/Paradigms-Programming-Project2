Markov Chain Sampling Methods for Dirichlet Process Mixture Models
 Abstract.  Markov chain methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of a Dirichlet process mixture model are reviewed, and two new classes of methods are presented.  One new approach is to make Metropolis-Hastings updates of the indicators specifying which mixture component is associated with each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of Gibbs sampling.  The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for these indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters.  These methods are simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways of handling general Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate priors.
