Darwinian Programming and Engineering Design Using Genetic Programming
 ABSTRACT One of the central challenges of computer science is to build a system that can automatically create computer programs that are competitive with those produced by humans.  This paper presents a candidate set of criteria that identify when a machine-created solution is competitive with a human-produced result.  We argue that the field of design is a useful testbed for determining whether an automated technique can produce results that are competitive with human-produced results.  We present several results that are competitive with the products of human creativity and inventiveness.  This claim is supported by the fact that each of the results infringe on previously issued patents.
