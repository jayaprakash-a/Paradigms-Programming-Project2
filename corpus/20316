The Weaver System for Document Retrieval
 Abstract This paper introduces Weaver, a probabilistic document retrieval system under development at Carnegie Mellon University, and discusses its performance in the TREC-8 ad hoc evaluation.  We begin by describing the architecture and philosophyoftheWeaver system, which represents a departure from traditional approaches to retrieval.  The central ingredient is a statistical model of how a user might distill or "translate" a given documentinto a query.  The retrieval-as-translation approach is based on the noisy channel paradigm and statistical language modeling, and has much in common with other recently proposed models [12, 10].  After the initial high-level overview, the bulk of the paper contains a discussion of implementation details and the empirical performance of the Weaver retrieval system.
