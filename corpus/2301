Multiple bumps in a neuronal model of working memory
 Abstract We study a partial integro-differential equation defined on a spatially extended domain that arises from the modeling of \working" or short-term memory in a neuronal network.  The equation is capable of supporting spatially localized regions of high activity which can be switched \on" and \o#" by transient external stimuli.  We analyze the effects of coupling between units in the network, showing that if the connection strengths decay monotonically with distance then no more than one region of high activity can persist, whereas if they decay in an oscillatory fashion then multiple regions can persist.
