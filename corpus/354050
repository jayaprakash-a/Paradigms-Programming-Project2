Approximating Minimum Cuts in () Time
 Abstract We improve on randomsampling techniquesfor approximately solving problems that involve cuts in graphs.  We give a lineartime construction that transforms any graph on n vertices into an O(n log n)-edge graphon the same vertices whose cuts have approximately the same value as the original graph's.  In this new graph, for example, we can run the ~ O(mn)-time maximum flow algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan to find an s--t minimum cut in ~ O(n 2 ) time.  This corresponds to a (1 + ffl)-times minimum s--t cut in the original graph.  In a similar way, we can approximate a sparsest cut in ~ O(n 2 ) time.
