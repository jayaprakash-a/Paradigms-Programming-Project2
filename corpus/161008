Piecing Together the Emotion Jigsaw
 Abstract.  People are emotional, and machines are not.  That constrains their communication, and defines a key challenge for the information sciences.  Different groups have addressed it from different angles, trying to develop methods of detecting emotion, agents that convey emotion, systems that predict behaviour in emotional circumstances, and so on.  Progress has been limited.  The new network of excellence HUMAINE explores the idea that progress depends on addressing the problem as a whole, not in isolated fragments.
