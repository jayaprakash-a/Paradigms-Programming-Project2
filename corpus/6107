Probabilistic Models of Text and Link Structure for Hypertext Classification
 Abstract Most text classification methods treat each document as an independent instance.  However, in many text domains, documents are linked and the topics of linked documents are correlated.  For example, web pages of related topics are often connected by hyperlinks and scientific papers from related fields are commonly linked by citations.  We propose a unified probabilistic model for both the textual content and the link structure of a document collection.  Our model is based on the recently introduced framework of Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), which allows us to capture correlations between linked documents.  We show how to learn these models from data and use them efficiently for
