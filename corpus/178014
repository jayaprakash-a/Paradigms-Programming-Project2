Wide-Range, Picoampere-Sensitivity Multichannel VLSI Potentiostat for Neurotransmitter Sensing
 Abstract--- Neurotransmitter sensing is critical in studying nervous pathways and neurological disorders.  A 16-channel currentmeasuring VLSI potentiostat with multiple ranges from picoamperes to microamperes is presented for electrochemical detection of electroactive neurotransmitters like dopamine, nitric oxide etc.  The analog-to-digital converter design employs a current-mode, first-order single-bit delta-sigma modulator architecture with a two-stage, digitally reconfigurable oversampling ratio for ranging the conversion scale.  An integrated prototype is fabricated in CMOS technology, and experimentally characterized.  Real-time multi-channel acquisition of dopamine concentration in vitro is performed with a microfabricated sensor array.
