Dissimilarity computation through low rank corrections
 Abstract Most of the energy of a multivariate feature is often contained in a low dimensional subspace.  We exploit this property for the e)cient computation of a dissimilarity measure between features using an approximation of the Bhattacharyya distance.  We show that for normally distributed features the Bhattacharyya distance is a particular case of the Jensen--Shannon divergence, and thus evaluation of this distance is equivalent to a statistical test about the similarity of the two populations.  The accuracy of the proposed approximation is tested for the task of texture retrieval.
