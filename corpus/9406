A 200MHz, 3mW, 16-Tap Mixed-Signal FIR Filter
 Abstract We have built a 16-tap, 7-bit, 200MHz, mixed-signal FIR filter that consumes 3mW at 3. 3V.  The filter uses p-channel synapse transistors to store the tap coefficients; electron tunneling and hot-electron injection to modify the tap weights; digital registers for the delay line; and multiplying digital-toanalog converters to multiply the digital delay-line values with the analog tap weights.  The measured bandwidth is 225MHz; the measured tap multiplier resolution is 7 bits at 200MHz.  The total die area is 0. 13mm 2 ; we can readily scale the design to higher bit resolutions and longer delay-lines.
