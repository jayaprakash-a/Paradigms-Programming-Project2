BETWEENAND WITHIN FIELD VARIABILITY OF NEW ZEALAND INDIGENOUS FLOWER VISITORS TO ONIONS
 ABSTRACT In New Zealand, few studies have documented the occurrence of indigenous flower visitors within crops.  A five-year survey is examining the distribution, diversity and abundance of flower visitors in onion (Allium cepa) fields located throughout New Zealand.  Day-time observations from the first year of the survey recorded nine arthropod orders visiting onion flowers in the South Island, with Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera being the most abundant.  Over six fields the proportion of bees that were indigenous species (Apoidea) ranged from <1% to 63. 6%.  Common bee genera and fly families varied considerably in their presence and abundance, even over 17 km.  Moreover, counts of Lasioglossum spp.  at five points within one field ranged from 0 to 576, demonstrating that the distribution of some flower visitors can be highly variable.  Understanding crop flower visitors may help develop systems to reduce transgene flow should genetically modified crops be commercially produced in New Zealand.
