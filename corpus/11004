MRI Inter-slice Reconstruction Using Super-Resolution
 Abstract MRI reconstruction using super-resolution is presented and shown to improve spatial resolution in cases when spatially-selective RF pulses are used for localization.  In 2-D multislice MRI, the resolution in the slice direction is often lower than the in-plane resolution.  For certain diagnostic imaging applications, isotropic resolution is necessary but true 3-D acquisition methods are not practical.  In this case, if the imaging volume is acquired two or more times, with small spatial shifts between acquisitions, combination of the data sets using an iterative superresolution algorithm gives improved resolution and better edge definition in the slice-select direction.  Resolution augmentation in MRI is important for visualization and early diagnosis.  The method also improves the signal-to-noise efficiency of the data acquisition.
