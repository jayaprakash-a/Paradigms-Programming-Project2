Large-Margin Matrix Factorization
 Abstract We present a novel approach to collaborative prediction, using low-norm instead of low-rank factorizations.  The approach is inspired by, and has strong connections to, large-margin linear discrimination.  We show how to learn low-norm factorizations by solving a semi-definite program, and present generalization error bounds based on analyzing the Rademacher complexity of low-norm factorizations.
