Randomized RANSAC
 Abstract Many computer vision algorithms include a robust estimation step where model parameters are computed from a data set containing a significant proportion of outliers.  The RANSAC algorithm is possibly the most widely used robust estimator in the field of computer vision.  In the paper we show that under a broad range of conditions, RANSAC efficiency is significantly improved if hypothesis evaluation is randomized.  A new randomized (hypothesis evaluation) version of RANSAC, R-RANSAC, is introduced.  Computational savings are achieved by typically evaluating only a fraction of data points for models contaminated with outliers.  The idea is implemented in a two-step evaluation procedure.  A mathematically tractable class of statistical preverification tests for test samples is introduced.  For this class we derive an approximate relation for optimal setting of its single parameter.  The proposed pre-test is verified on both synthetic data and real-world problems and a significant increase in speed is shown.
