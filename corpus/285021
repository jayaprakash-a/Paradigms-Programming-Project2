Tensor Embedding of the Fundamental Matrix
 Doing that weintroduce a 3 # 3 # 3 tensor F jk i ,we call the bifocal tensor, that represents the bilinear constraint.  The bifocal and trifocal tensors share the same form and share the same contraction properties.  By close inspection of the contractions of the bifocal tensor into matrices we show that one can represent the family of rank-2 homography matrices by[#]#F where # is a free vector.  We then discuss four applications of the new representation: (i) Quasi-metric viewing of projective data, (ii) triangulation, (iii) view synthesis, and (iv) recovery of camera ego-motion from a stream of views.
