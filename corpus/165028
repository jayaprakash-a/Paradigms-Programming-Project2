ON THE MOMENTS OF THE SCALING FUNCTION
 ABSTRACT This paper derives relationships between the moments of the scaling function /0(t) associated with multiplicity M , K-regular, compactly supported, orthonormal wavelet bases [6, 5], that are extensions of the multiplicity 2, K-regular orthonormal wavelet bases constructed by Daubechies [2].  One such relationship is that the square of the first moment of the scaling function (/0(t)) is equal to its second moment.  This relationship is used to show that uniform sample values of a function provides a third order approximation of its scaling function expansion coefficients.  For the special case of M = 2, the results in this paper have been reported earlier [3].
