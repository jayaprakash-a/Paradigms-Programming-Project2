Computer Science Technical Report Fast Generation of NURBS Surfaces from Polygonal Mesh Models of Human Anatomy
 Abstract Visible Productions, Inc. , of Fort Collins, CO, produces 3-D human models that are recognized as some of the most accurate models in the world.  Their models currently are based on meshes of 3-D triangles.  Such meshes can be rendered as smooth surfaces byinterpolating color values across a triangular mesh, but for a number of applications the smooth surface must be explicitly represented.  Clients for Visible Productions' models have asked for surfaces defined by NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines).  This project developed and implemented algorithms for transforming polygonal meshes into NURBS.  This requires a time-intensive, iterative optimization process.  Weinvestigated the use of neural networks to by-pass a large part of the optimization process.
