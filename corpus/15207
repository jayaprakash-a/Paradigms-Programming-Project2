tex Independent Component Analysis and Projection Pursuit: A Tutorial Introduction.  Abstract Independent component analysis (ICA) and projection pursuit (PP) are two related techniques for separating mixtures of source signals into their individual components.  These rapidly evolving techniques are currently finding applications in speech separation, ERP, EEG, fMRI, and low-level vision.  Their power resides in the simple and realistic assumption that different physical processes tend to generate statistically independent signals.  We provide an account that is intended as an informal introduction, as well as a mathematical and geometric description of the methods.
