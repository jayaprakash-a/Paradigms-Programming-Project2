Combining online algorithms for rejection and acceptance
 ABSTRACT Resource allocation and admission control are critical tasks in a communication network, that often must be performed online.  Algorithms for these types of problems have been considered both under benefit models (e. g. , with a goal of approximately maximizing the number of calls accepted) and under cost models (e. g. , with a goal of approximately minimizing the number of calls rejected).  Unfortunately, algorithms designed for these two measures can often be quite different, even polar opposites (e. g. , [1, 8]).  In this work we consider the problem of combining algorithms designed for each of these objectives in a way that simultaneously is good under both measures.  More formally, we are given an algorithm A which is cA competitive w. r. t.  the number of accepted calls and an algorithm R which is cR competitive w. r. t.  the number of rejected calls.  We derive a combined algorithm whose competitive ratio is O(cRcA) for rejection and O(c 2 A ) for acceptance.  We also show building on known techniques that given a collection of k algorithms, we can construct one master algorithm which performs similar to the best algorithm among the k for the acceptance problem and another master algorithm which performs similar to the best algorithm among the k for the rejection problem.  Using our main result we can combine the two master algorithms to a single algorithm which guarantees both rejection and acceptance competitiveness.
