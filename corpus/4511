SEEMORE: Combining Color, Shape and Texture Histogramming in a Neurally-Inspired Approach to Visual Object Recognition
 Abstract Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy.  To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult 3-D object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field-based recognition model called seemore.  seemore is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters which are as a group sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues.  The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including rigid (shovel), non-rigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects, and photographs of complex scenes.  Objects were individually-presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions.
