Motif Extraction and Protein Classification
 Abstract We present a novel unsupervised method for extracting meaningful motifs from biological sequence data.  This de novo motif extraction (MEX) algorithm is data driven, finding motifs that are not necessarily over-represented in the data.  Applying MEX to the oxidoreductases class of enzymes a relatively small set of motifs is obtained.  This set spans a motif-space that is used for functional classification of the enzymes by an SVM classifier.  The classification based on MEX motifs surpasses that of two other SVM based methods: SVMProt, a method based on the analysis of physical-chemical properties of a protein generated from its sequence of amino acids, and SVM applied to a SmithWaterman distances matrix.  Our findings demonstrate that the MEX algorithm extracts relevant motifs, supporting a successful sequence-to-function classification.
