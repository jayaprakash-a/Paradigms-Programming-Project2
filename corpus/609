Focused Word Segmentation for ASR
 Abstract We propose a new set of features based on the temporal statistics of the spectral entropy of speech.  We show why these features make good inputs for a speech detector.  Moreover, we propose a back-end that uses the evidence from the above features in a `focused' manner.  Subsequently, by means of recognition experiments we show that using the above back-end leads to significant performance improvements, but merely appending the features to the standard feature vector does not improve performance.  We also report a 10% average improvement in word error rate over our baseline for the highly mis-matched case in the Aurora3. 0 corpus.
