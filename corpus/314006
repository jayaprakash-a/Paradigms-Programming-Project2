The Whole World in Your Hand: Active and Interactive Segmentation
 Abstract Object segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and a powerful resource for development.  This paper presents three embodied approaches to the visual segmentation of objects.  Each approach to segmentation is aided by the presence of a hand or arm in the proximity of the object to be segmented.  The first approach is suitable for a robotic system, where the robot can use its arm to evoke object motion.  The second method operates on a wearable system, viewing the world from a human's perspective, with instrumentation to help detect and segment objects that are held in the wearer's hand.  The third method operates when observing a human teacher, locating periodic motion (finger/arm/object waving or tapping) and using it as a seed for segmentation.  We show that object segmentation can serve as a key resource for development by demonstrating methods that exploit high-quality object segmentations to develop both low-level vision capabilities (specialized feature detectors) and high-level vision capabilities (object recognition and localization).
