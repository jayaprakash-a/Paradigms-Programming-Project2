INTEGRATING SMALL FORMAT AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY, VIDEOGRAPHY, AND A LASER PROFILER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
 semi-automatic, cost-effective methodologies for monitoring environmental parameters over large areas.  To meet these challenges we built a moderate cost system comprised of offthe-shelf instruments, including a differential GPS, a 3-axis solid state attitude and heading reference system, two mini-DV camcorders, a small format aerial survey camera, a profiling laser altimeter, and a PC based data acquisition system.  The quality and format of the video and digitized photographic data were chosen to provide high quality input to several state-of-the-are computer vision algorithms for 3D terrain modeling, and ground cover classification.  Although the work described in this paper is in a preliminary phase and all of the constituent technologies have not been fully integrated, we nevertheless demonstrated the value and feasibility of using the system to solve environmental monitoring problems on a large scale.
