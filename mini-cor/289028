Automatic Model Selection for Support Vector Machines
 Abstract Automatic model selection is an important issue to make support vector machines (SVM) practically useful.  Most existing approaches use the leave-one-out (loo) related estimators.  As finding the loo rate is time consuming, researchers exploit different techniques to approximate it.  Therefore, they develop methods mainly from a machine learning point of view while numerical experiments are usually not seriously treated.  Up to now, most existing SVM software cannot do effective automatic model selections.  We think that if the calculation of loo is a dicult numerical issue, more investigation from a numerical point of view should be conducted.  In this paper, we study the relation between the loo rate and the stopping criteria of the decomposition method for SVM.  For each particular model, the computation of loo involves a sequence of standard SVM problems.  We show that using a very loose stopping criteria for the decomposition method, the best model can still be obtained.  Such an observation leads us to be able to design simple and practical automatic model selection software.
