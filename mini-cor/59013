Synthesis of Static and Dynamic Multiple-Input Translinear Element Networks
 Abstract In this report, we shall review some of the basic concepts of translinear circuits and establish their connection to the theory of networks of multiple-input translinear elements (MITEs).  We shall also establish some basic important results relating to the construction of MITE networks from translinear-loop equations and illustrate the basic construction procedure with some simple examples.  Then, we turn to discuss the process of synthesizing static and dynamic MITE networks from high-level descriptions given in the time domain in terms of static polynomial constraints and algebraic differential equations and provide several examples, illustrating the process for both static and dynamic system constraints.
