Applying the Deterministic Annealing Expectation Maximisation Algorithm to Naive Bayesian Networks
 Abstract The deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm has been proposed as a means to improve the estimation of parameters in models for which we have incomplete data.  Here we apply the DAEM algorithm to parameter estimation in naive Bayesian networks and note that problems arise, namely that the algorithm often converges to the equally weighted independence model.  I.  BAYESIAN NETWORKS A Bayesian Network is a means of representing relationships between a number of variables in some domain, ######################### .  A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is used to represent the relationships between variables; nodes in the graph represent the variables themselves and arcs between them are used to indicate cause and effect, arcs being drawn from the causative variable to its immediate effect.  Associated with each variable, ### , are two subsets of # known as the parents and children of # # .  These are, respectively, the set of all variables having a direct effect upon # # and the set of all variables which are directly affected by # # .  Figure 1 shows a simple DAG representing the
