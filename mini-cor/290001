Self-organized pattern formation: experimental dissection of motion detection and motion integration by variation of attentional spread
 Abstract The formation of global motion patterns depends on the stimulus activation of local motion detectors as well as integrative excitatory and/or inhibitory interactions among the activated detectors.  The counterphase row-of-elements [Vis.  Res.  34 (1994) 1843] is an ideal stimulus for examining the relationship between the activational/energizing e6ect of the stimulus and interaction among the activated detectors.  This is because the formation of the alternative unidirectional and oscillatory motion patterns for this stimulus requires the stimulation of local motion detectors, but there is no information in the stimulus that specifies either of the patterns.  Their formation depends instead on the relative contributions of excitatory and inhibitory interactions to detector activation; the temporal patterns are self-organized.  Broadly spread attention a6ects motion integration by changing the balance of excitatory versus inhibitory interactions, increasing the perception of unidirectional compared with oscillatory motion.
