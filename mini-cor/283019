An Efficient Implementation of Sigmoidal Neural Nets in Temporal Coding with Noisy Spiking Neurons
 Abstract We show that networks of rather realistic models for biological neurons can in principle simulate arbitrary feedforward sigmoidal neural nets in a way which has previously not been considered.  This new approach is based on temporal coding by single spikes (respectively by the timing of synchronous firing in pools of neurons), rather than on the traditional interpretation of analog variables in terms of firing rates.  The resulting new simulation is substantially faster and apparently more consistent with experimental results about fast information processing in cortical neural systems.  As a consequence we can show that networks of noisy spiking neurons are "universal approximators" in the sense that they can approximate with regard to temporal coding any given continuous function of several variables.  Our new proposal for the possible organization of computations in biological neural systems has some interesting consequences for the type of learning rules that would be needed to explain the self-organization of such neural circuits.  Finally, our fast and noise-robust implementation of sigmoidal neural nets via temporal coding points to possible new ways of implementing sigmoidal neural nets with pulse stream VLSI.
