ROBUST SPEECH FEATURE EXTRACTION BY GROWTH TRANSFORMATION IN REPRODUCING KERNEL HILBERT SPACE
 ABSTRACT A robust speech feature extraction procedure, by kernel regression nonlinear predictive coding, is presented.  Features maximally insensitive to additive noise are obtained by growth transformation of regression functions spanning a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).  Experiments on TI-DIGIT demonstrate consistent robustness of the new features to noise of varying statistics, yielding significant improvements in digit recognition accuracy over identical models trained using Mel-scale cepstral features and evaluated at noise levels between 0 and 30 dB SNR.
