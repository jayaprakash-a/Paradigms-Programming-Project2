Learning to Parse Pictures of People
 body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations.  RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation.  We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations.
