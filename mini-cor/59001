Single Transistor Learning Synapses
 ABSTRACT We describe the design, fabrication, characterization, and modeling of an array of single transistor synapses.  The single transistor synapses simultaneously perform long term weight storage, compute the product of the input and floating gate value, and update the weight value according to a hebbian or a backpropagation learning rule.  The charge on the floating gate is decreased by hot electron injection with high selectiviy for a particular synapse.  The charge on the floating gate is increased by electron tunneling, which results in high selectivity between rows, but much lower selectivity between columns along a row.  When the steady state source current is used as the representation of the weight value, both the incrementing and decrementing functions are proportional to a power of the source current.
