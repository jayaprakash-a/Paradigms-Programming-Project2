The BANCA Database and Evaluation Protocol
 Abstract.  In this paper we describe the acquisition and content of a new large, realistic and challenging multi-modal database intended for training and testing multi-modal verification systems.  The BANCA database was captured in four European languages in two modalities (face and voice).  For recording, both high and low quality microphones and cameras were used.  The subjects were recorded in three different scenarios, controlled, degraded and adverse over a period of three months.  In total 208 people were captured, half men and half women.  In this paper we also describe a protocol for evaluating verification algorithms on the database.  The database will be made available to the research community
