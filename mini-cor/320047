DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science Nearest Neighbor Search for Data Compression
 Abstract.  Vector Quantization is a lossy data compression method whose running time is dominated by a series of nearest neighbor searches.  In this paper, we empirically compare six nearest neighbor search algorithms for performing vector quantization.  Three of these algorithms were designed specifically for vector quantization.  One is the traditional k-d tree algorithm.  The other two are new algorithms based on the idea of principal component partitioning.
