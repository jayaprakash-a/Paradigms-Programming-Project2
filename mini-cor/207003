Topic-Specific Scoring of Documents with Discrete PCA
 More sophisticated language models are starting to be used in information retrieval [8] and real successes are being achieved in their use [4].  A document modelling approach based on discrete versions of PCA [7, 1, 2] has been applied to the language modelling task in information retrieval [2, 3].  Here we apply the same discrete PCA method to topic specific versions of page rank [6, 10].  Our intent is that this can be used as a secondary score to add topical scoring to retrieval in conjunction with a separate key-word based score such as TFIDF.
