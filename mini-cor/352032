A Connectionist Simulation of the Empirical Acquisition of Grammatical Relations
 In contrast to this approach, we propose that grammatical relations emerge rather late in the language-learning process.  Our theoretical proposal is based on two observations.  First, early production of childhood speech is formulaic and becomes systematic in a progressive fashion.  Second, grammatical relations themselves are family-resemblance categories that cannot be described by a single parameter.  This leads to the notion that grammatical relations are learned in a bottom up fashion.  Combining this theoretical position with the notion that the main purpose of language is communication, we demonstrate the emergence of the notion of "subject" in a simple recurrent network that learns to map from sentences to semantic roles.  We analyze the hidden layer representations of the emergent subject, and demonstrate that these representations correspond to a radially--structured category.  We also claim that the pattern of generalization and undergeneralization demonstrated by the network conforms to what we expect from the data on children's generalizations.
