Utilities as Random Variables: Density Estimation and Structure Discovery
 Abstract Decision theory does not traditionally include uncertainty over utility functions.  We argue that the a person's utility value for a given outcome can be treated as we treat other domain attributes: as a random variable with a density function over its possible values.  We show that we can apply statistical density estimation techniques to learn such a density function from a database of partially elicited utility functions.  In particular, we define a Bayesian learning framework for this problem, assuming the distribution over utilities is a mixture of Gaussians, where the mixture components represent statistically coherent subpopulations.  We can also extend our techniques to the problem of discovering generalized additivity structure in the utility functions in the population.  We define a Bayesian model selection criterion for utility function structure and a search procedure over structures.  The
