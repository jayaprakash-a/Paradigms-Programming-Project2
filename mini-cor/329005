Finding Point Correspondences in Motion Sequences Preserving Ane Structure
 Abstract In this paper the problem of computing the point correspondences in a sequence of time-varying images of a 3D object undergoing non-rigid (ane) motion is addressed.  It is assumed that the images are obtained through ane projections.  The correspondences are established only from the analysis of the unknown 3D ane structure of the object, without making use of any attributes of the feature points.  It is shown that it is possible to establish the point correspondences uniquely (up to symmetry) in the sense that they yield a unique ane structure of the object and that the computation is possible in polynomial time.  Two different algorithms for computing the point correspondences are presented.  Results on various real image sequences, including a sequence containing independently moving objects, demonstrate the applicability of the structure based approach to motion correspondence.
