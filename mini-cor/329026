Minimal Training, Large Lexicon, Unconstrained Sign Language Recognition
 Abstract This paper presents a flexible monocular system capable of recognising sign lexicons far greater in number than previous approaches.  The power of the system is due to four key elements: (i) Head and hand detection based upon boosting which removes the need for temperamental colour segmentation; (ii) A body centred description of activity which overcomes issues with camera placement, calibration and user; (iii) A two stage classification in which stage I generates a high level linguistic description of activity which naturally generalises and hence reduces training; (iv) A stage II classifier bank which does not require HMMs, further reducing training requirements.  The outcome of which is a system capable of running in real-time, and generating extremely high recognition rates for large lexicons with as little as a single training instance per sign.  We demonstrate classification rates as high as 92% for a lexicon of 164 words with extremely low training requirements outperforming previous approaches where thousands of training examples are required.
