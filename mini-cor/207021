The Handbook of Probability in Computing: Interactive Media for Research
 Abstract The paper outlines a Handbook being developed for distribution on the World-Wide Web.  The Handbook combines an encyclopaedia with an annotated bibliography, tutorials, and links to community events and software.  The Encyclopaedia and Annotated Bibliography form the center piece of the Handbook.  Their development will be distributed amongst the community, driven by community reviewing and authorship.  This is an experiment in network-based research cooperation that we hope will be a model for future publication and education media.  This paper outlines the proposed Handbook, discusses the benefits to the uncertainty community, and discusses some of the development issues involved.  Finally, this paper calls for community feedback and involvement.
