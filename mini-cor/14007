Identification of High p? Particles with the STAR-RICH Detector
 Abstract The STAR-RICH detector extends the particle identification capabilities of the STAR experiment for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity.  This detector represents the first use of a proximity-focusing CsI-based RICH detector in a collider experiment.  It provides identification of pions and kaons up to 3 GeV/c and protons up to 5 GeV/c.  The characteristics and performance of the device in the inaugural RHIC run are described.
