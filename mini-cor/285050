On the Equivalence Between the Support Vector Machine for Classification and Sparsified Fisher's Linear Discriminant
 Abstract.  We show that the orientation and location of the separating hyperplane for 2-class supervised pattern classification obtained by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) proposed byVapnik and his colleagues, is equivalent to the solution obtained by Fisher's Linear Discriminant on the set of Support Vectors.  In other words, SVM can be seen as a way to \sparsify" Fisher's Linear Discriminant in order to obtain the most generalizing classification from the training set.
