Unsupervised Texture Segmentation in a Deterministic Annealing Framework
 Abstract We present a novel optimization framework for unsupervised texture segmentation that relies on statistical tests as a measure of homogeneity.  Texture segmentation is formulated as a data clustering problem based on sparse proximity data.  Dissimilarities of pairs of textured regions are computed from a multi{scale Gabor filter image representation.  We discuss and compare a class of clustering objective functions which is systematically derived from invariance principles.  As a general optimization framework we propose deterministic annealing based on a mean{#eld approximation.  The canonical way to derive clustering algorithms within this framework as well as an efficient implementation of mean{#eld annealing and the closely related Gibbs sampler are presented.  We apply both annealing variants to Brodatz{like micro{texture mixtures and real{word images.
