Brains on wheels: Mobile robots for brain research
 Abstract: Two mysteries of brains are focussed in this article from a roboticist's view.  The first is the brain's capacity to make sense of real-life sensoric input, which differs strongly from experimentally administered stimuli.  Another riddle posed by biological brains lies in the fact that brain subsystems are functionally indeterminate when seen in isolation, and acquire different functions when they interact with different other subsystems and receive different sensor input ("multi-functionality").  The paper describes insights gained in designing robots which directly relate to these two fundamental questions.  Experiences with a "behavior-based" robot, the Black Knight (BK), are reported in some detail.  BK had to work in an environment which was so messy that a formal modeling of the sensoric stimuli expected for the robot was out of the question.  BK's control program makes do without explicit representations of external circumstances, and relies on "acting things out" instead.  This leads to a deeper understanding of the real-life input problem.  With respect to the multi-functionality problem, BK offers surprising insights since it is construed and programmed as a dynamical system comprised of many open subsystems ("behaviors").  Open dynamical systems intrinsically are functionally indeterminate.  While the reported methodology and results are of some interest for their own sake, the superordinate goal of this paper is to promote robot experiments as a tool for brain research.
