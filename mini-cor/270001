Sequence motifs: highly predictive features of protein function
 Summary.  Protein function prediction, i. e.  classification of protein sequences according to their biological function is an important task in bioinformatics.  In this chapter we illustrate that the presence of sequence motifs -- elements that are conserved across dierent proteins -- are highly discriminative features for predicting the function of a protein.  This is in agreement with the biological thinking that considers motifs to be the building blocks of protein sequences.  We focus on proteins annotated as enzymes, and show that despite the fact that motif composition is a very high dimensional representation of a sequence, that most classes of enzymes can be classified using a handful of motifs, yielding accurate and interpretable classifiers.  The enzyme data falls into a large number of classes; we find that the one-againstthe-rest multi-class method works better than the one-against-one method on this data.
