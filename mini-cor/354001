Random sampling and greedy sparsification for matroid optimization problems
 Abstract Random sampling is a powerful tool for gathering information about a group by considering only a small part of it.  We discuss some broadly applicable paradigms for using random sampling in combinatorial optimization, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these paradigms for two optimization problems on matroids: finding an optimum matroid basis and packing disjoint matroid bases.  Applications of these ideas to the graphic matroid led to fast algorithms for minimum spanning trees and minimum cuts.  An optimum matroid basis is typically found by a greedy algorithm that grows an independent set into an the optimum basis one element at a time.  This continuous change in the independent set can make it hard to perform the independence tests needed by the greedy algorithm.  We simplify matters by using sampling to reduce the problem of finding an optimum matroid basis to the problem of verifying that a given fixed basis is optimum, showing that the two problems can be solved in roughly the same time.  Another application of sampling is to packing matroid bases, also known as matroid partitioning.  Sampling reduces the number of bases that must be packed.  We combine sampling with a greedy packing strategy that reduces the size of the matroid.  Together, these techniques give accelerated packing algorithms.  We give particular attention to the problem of packing spanning trees in graphs, which has applications in network reliability analysis.  Our results can be seen as generalizing certain results from random graph theory.  The techniques have also been effective for other packing problems.
