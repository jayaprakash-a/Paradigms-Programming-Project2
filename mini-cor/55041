Zero-096 Games in ExtensiveForm
 This paper investigates the complexity offi 3160 max-min strategies forfior 4 two-person zero-sum games in the extensive form.  The problem of determining whether a player with imperfect recall can guarantee himself a certain payoff is shown to be NP-hard.  When both players have imperfect recall, this is even harder.  Moreover, the max-min behavior strategy of such a player may use irrational numbers.  Thus, for games with imperfect recall, computing the max-min strategy or the value of the game is a hard problem.  For a game with perfect recall, we present an algorithm for computing a max-min behavior strategy, which runs in time polynomial in the size of the game tree.
