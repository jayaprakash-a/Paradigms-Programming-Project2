Variational Bayes estimation of mixing coefficients
 Abstract We investigate theoretically some properties of variational Bayes approximations based on estimating the mixing coefficients of known densities.  We show that, with probability 1 as the sample size n grows large, the iterative algorithm for the variational Bayes approximation converges locally to the maximum likelihood estimator at the rate of O(1/n).  Moreover, the variational posterior distribution for the parameters is shown to be asymptotically normal with the same mean but a different covariance matrix compared with those for the maximum likelihood estimator.  Furthermore we prove that the covariance matrix from the variational Bayes approximation is `too small' compared with that for the MLE, so that resulting interval estimates for the parameters will be unrealistically narrow.
