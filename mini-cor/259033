On-line Robot Adaptation to Environmental Change
 Abstract Robots performing tasks constantly encounter changing environmental conditions.  These changes in the environment vary from the dramatic, such as rearrangement of furniture, to the subtle, such as a burnt out light bulb.  We do not recognize many of these changes, especially subtle changes, but robots do.  I propose to use robotic sensor data to identify and adapt to these environmental changes.  Traditional sensor models do not scale well in the face of these frequent environmental changes.  My approach is to aggregate sensor readings into probability distributions and associate them on-line with the state of the environment.  I will use the Sony AIBO robots as a test platform to verify the efficacy of the techniques I develop.
