TITLE: Encoding and retrieval in the CA3 region of the hippocampus: a model of theta phase separation AUTHORS:
 Abstract Past research (Hasselmo et al.  2002) suggests that some fundamental tasks are better accomplished if memories are encoded and recovered during different parts of the theta cycle.  A model of the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus is presented, using biophysical representations of the major cell types including pyramidal cells and two types of interneurons.  Inputs to the network come from the septum and the entorhinal cortex (directly and via the dentate gyrus).  A mechanism for parsing the theta rhythm into two epochs is proposed and simulated: in the first half, the strong, proximal input from the dentate to a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells and coincident, direct input from the entorhinal cortex to other pyramidal cells creates an environment for strengthening synapses between cells, thus encoding information.  During the second half of theta, cueing signals from the entorhinal cortex, via the dentate, activate previously strengthened synapses, retrieving memories.  Slow inhibitory neurons (O-LM cells) play a role in the disambiguation during retrieval.  We compare and contrast our computational results with existing experimental data and other contemporary models.
