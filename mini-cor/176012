The EM Algorithm for Mixtures of Factor Analyzers
 Abstract Factor analysis, a statistical method for modeling the covariance structure of high dimensional data using a small number of latent variables, can be extended by allowing different local factor models in different regions of the input space.  This results in a model which concurrently performs clustering and dimensionality reduction, and can be thought of as a reduced dimension mixture of Gaussians.  We present an exact Expectation--Maximization algorithm for fitting the parameters of this mixture of factor analyzers.
