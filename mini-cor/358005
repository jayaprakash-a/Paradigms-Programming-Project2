Particle Filtering for Partially Observed Gaussian State Space Models
 Summary.  Solving Bayesian estimation problems where the posterior distribution evolves over time through the accumulation of data has many applications for dynamic models.  A large number of algorithms based on particle filtering methods, also known as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), have recently been proposed to solve these problems.  In this paper, we propose a special particle filtering method which uses random mixtures of normal distributions to represent the posterior distributions of partially observed Gaussian state space models.  This algorithm is based on a marginalization idea for improving efficiency and can lead to substantial gains over standard algorithms.  It differs from previous algorithms described in Chen and Liu (2000) and Doucet et al.  (2000), which were only applicable to conditionally linear Gaussian state space models.  Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for dynamic Tobit and Probit models.
