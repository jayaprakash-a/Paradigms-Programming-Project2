Token-level Disambiguation of VerbNet classes
 Abstract The automatic disambiguation of verbs in domain independent text becomes more and more important for applications such as Machine Translation, Text Summarization, and Question Answering, mainly because verbs play a key factor in the syntactic and semantic interpretation of sentences.  In this paper we present a system for the automatic classification of token verbs in context based on VerbNet classes.  A supervised machine learning classifier is trained and tested on a portion of PropBank using a set of lexical and syntactic features.
