Choice and Value Flexibility Jointly Contribute to the Capacity of a Subsampled Quadratic Classifier
 Abstract Biophysical modeling studies have suggested that neurons with active dendrites can be viewed as linear units augmented by product terms which arise from interactions between synaptic inputs within the same dendritic subregions.  However, the degree to which local nonlinear synaptic interactions augment the memory capacity of a neuron is not known in a quantitative sense.  To approach this question, we have studied the family of subsampled quadratic classifiers, i. e.  linear classifiers augmented by the best k terms from the set of K = (d 2 + d)=2 second-order product terms available in d dimensions.  We developed an expression for the total parameter entropy of an SQ classifier, whose form shows that the capacity of an SQ classifier does not reside solely in its conventional weight values
