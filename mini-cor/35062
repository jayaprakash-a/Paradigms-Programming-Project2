GTM Through Time
 Abstract The standard GTM (generative topographic mapping) algorithm assumes that the data on which it is trained consists of independent, identically distributed (i. i. d. ) vectors.  For time series, however, the i. i. d.  assumption is a poor approximation.  In this paper we show how the GTM algorithm can be extended to model time series by incorporating it as the emission density in a hidden Markov model.  Since GTM has discrete hidden states we are able to find a tractable EM algorithm, based on the forward-backward algorithm, to train the model.  We illustrate the performance of GTM through time using flight recorder data from a helicopter.
