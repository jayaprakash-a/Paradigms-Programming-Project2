Factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm
 Abstract---Algorithms that must deal with complicated global functions of many variables often exploit the manner in which the given functions factor as a product of "local" functions, each of which depends on a subset of the variables.  Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph.  In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph.  Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes---either exactly or approximately---various marginal functions derived from the global function.  A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative "turbo" decoding algorithm, Pearl's belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms.
