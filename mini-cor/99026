Spatial Dependence in the Observation of Visual Contours
 Abstract Two challenging problems in object recognition are: to output structures that can be interpreted statistically; and to degrade gracefully under occlusion.  This paper proposes a new method for addressing both problems simultaneously.  Specifically, a likelihood ratio termed the Markov discriminant is used to make statistical inferences about partially occluded objects.  The Markov discriminant is based on a probabilistic model of occlusion.  This model is a Markov random field, which acts as the prior for Bayesian estimation of the posterior using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.  The method takes as its starting point a "contour discriminant" designed to differentiate between a target and random background clutter.  We show that incorporating the prior on occlusions has two important advantages.  First, partially occluded targets are assigned reasonable relative probability distributions even when they appear in scenes with unoccluded targets; this would allow a higher-level system to perform useful reasoning subsequently.  Second, discrimination between partially occluded targets and background clutter is significantly improved.  Both these advances can be explained by theoretical reasoning, and are demonstrated in experiments.
