Unsupervised Learning of Models for Visual Object Class Recognition
 Abstract We present a method to learn object class models for the purpose of object recognition.  We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as constellations of rigid features (parts).  The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of feature detectors.  The pdf may be estimated from training data once a model structure (type and number of features) has been specified.  The method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set and learns the statistical shape model.  It is assumed that a set of generic feature detectors is available for the learning algorithm to choose from.  The entire set of model parameters is learned using expectation maximization.
