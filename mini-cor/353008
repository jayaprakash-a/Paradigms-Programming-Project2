Measured Effects of a Narrowband Interference Suppressor on GPS Receivers
 ABSTRACT Narrowband and partial-band interference can severely degrade the performance of GPS receivers.  The use of digital signal processing in a receiver has been shown to provide protection against this type of interference in communications systems and has been proposed for application in future GPS systems.  This paper discusses the measured effects of narrowband interference suppression on GPS receiver performance.  Emphasis is placed on its effects on pseudorange measurements, since navigation accuracy is ultimately the measure of interest to the user.  Performance metrics presented include: the GPS receiver input carrier-to-noise ratio, receiver crosscorrelation function, and pseudorange errors.  The results demonstrate that substantial interference suppression can be attained with modest navigation accuracy degradation by incorporating narrowband interference suppression technology into GPS receivers.
