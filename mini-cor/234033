Autonomous inverted helicopter flight via reinforcement learning
 Abstract.  Helicopters have highly stochastic, nonlinear, dynamics, and autonomous helicopter flight is widely regarded to be a challenging control problem.  As helicopters are highly unstable at low speeds, it is particularly difficult to design controllers for low speed aerobatic maneuvers.  In this paper, we describe a successful application of reinforcement learning to designing a controller for sustained inverted flight on an autonomous helicopter.  Using data collected from the helicopter in flight, we began by learning a stochastic, nonlinear model of the helicopter's dynamics.  Then, a reinforcement learning algorithm was applied to automatically learn a controller for autonomous inverted hovering.  Finally, the resulting controller was successfully tested on our autonomous helicopter platform.
