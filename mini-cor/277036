A Factorization Approach to Grouping
 Abstract The foreground group in a scene may be `discovered' and computed as a factorized approximation to the pairwise affinity of the elements in the scene.  A pointwise approximation of the pairwise affinity information may in fact be interpreted as a `saliency' index, and the foreground of the scene may be obtained by thresholding it.  An algorithm called `affinity factorization' is thus obtained whichmay be used for grouping.  The affinity factorization algorithm is demonstrated on displays com- posed of points, of lines and of brightness values.  Its relationship to the Shi-Malik normalized cuts algorithms is explored both analytically and experimentally.  The affinity factorization algorithm is shown to be com- putationally efficient (O(n) floating-point operations for a scene com- posed of n elements) and to perform well on displays where the back- ground is unstructured.  Generalizations to solve more complex problems are also discussed.
