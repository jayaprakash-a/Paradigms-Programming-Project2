Legitimacy, deliberative arenas and the new rural governance
 Abstract It is widely accep ted that new governance structures are necessary in order to address the challenges inherent in the aim of rural sustainable development.  There is also a widespread assumption, often elevated to a normative princip le, that to address the need for the integration of diverse interests such structures should bring stakeholders together in ways which encourage the development of consensus through deliberation.  However, effective governance structures must not only have the institutional capacity to act but also the legitimacy to do so.  Creating such structures is not straightforward: bringing stakeholders together may promote but does not guarantee any or all of sustainable development, legitimacy , or the capacity to manage territory .  This paper seeks therefore to open up debate on the legitimacy of different forms of deliberative governance structures and, further, whether the emphasis on creating new deliberative arenas is necessarily an improvement over more traditional forms of governance.  It draws on research which examined decision making for sustainable transport policy in a single national park -- the Peak District in England.  In order to integrate conf licting interests and build capacity to act the Park Authority established three very different types of deliberative arenas: strategic partnership working, local consensus-building, and an extension of its own representative democratic structures.  These were analysed to compare how stakeholders' interests were integrated or marginalised, and so the extent to which the structures' legitimacy was constructed and sustained as stakeholders also sought to satisfy the potentially conflicting demands of increasing effectiveness and advancing sustainable policies.
