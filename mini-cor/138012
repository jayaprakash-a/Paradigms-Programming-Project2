Ecient Population Registration of 3D Data
 Abstract We present a population registration framework that acts on large collections or populations of data volumes.  The data alignment procedure runs in a simultaneous fashion, with every member of the population approaching the central tendency of the collection at the same time.  Such a mechanism eliminates the need for selecting a particular reference frame a priori, resulting in a non-biased estimate of a digital atlas.  Our algorithm adopts an ane congealing framework with an information theoretic objective function and is optimized via a gradientbased stochastic approximation process embedded in a multi-resolution setting.  We present experimental results on both synthetic and real images.
