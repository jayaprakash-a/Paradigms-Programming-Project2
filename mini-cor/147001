Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
 Abstract We describe a probabilistic approach to the task of embedding highdimensional objects into a low-dimensional space in a way that preserves neighbor identities.  A Gaussian is centered on each object in the highdimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian are used to define a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object.  The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed in the low-dimensional space.  The natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object.  This leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of objects in the low-dimensional space.  Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each high-dimensional object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional points.  This allows the embeddings of ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word "bank", to be close to the embeddings of both "river" and "finance" without forcing outdoor concepts to be located close to corporate ones.
