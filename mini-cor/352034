Interactions between Frequency Effects and Age of Acquisition Effects in a Connectionist Network
 Abstract The performance of a connectionist network, in which some resources are absent or damaged is examined as a function of various learning parameters.  A learning environment is created by generating a set of random "prototypes" and clusters of exemplar vectors surrounding each prototype.  An autoencoder is trained on the patterns.  The robustness of each learned item is measured as a function of the time at which it was "acquired" by the network and its overall frequency in the environment.  Both factors are shown to influence robustness under several learning conditions.
