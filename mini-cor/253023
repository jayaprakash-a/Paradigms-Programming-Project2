Packet error rate and bit error rate non-deterministic relationship in optical network applications
 Abstract: The non-deterministic relationship between Bit Error Rate and Packet Error Rate is demonstrated for an optical media access layer in common use.  We show that frequency components of coded, non-random data can cause this relationship.
