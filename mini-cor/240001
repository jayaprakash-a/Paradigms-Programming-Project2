Extending the shine-through effect to classical masking paradigms
 Abstract A vernier, presented for a short time, shines through a following grating if the grating contains nine and more elements but remains largely invisible for smaller gratings.  Therefore, extended grating masks yield, surprisingly, less masking than smaller ones.  Here, we show that this mask size effect is not unique to grating masks.  Masking diminishes if the size of classical pattern-, noise-, light-, and metacontrast masks increases and if these masks are regular, i. e.  highly ordered.
