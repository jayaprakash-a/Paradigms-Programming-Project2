Detection of animals in natural images using far peripheral vision
 Abstract It is generally believed that the acuity of the peripheral visual eld is too poor to allow accurate object recognition and, that to be identied, most objects need to be brought into foveal vision by using saccadic eye movements.  However, most measures of form vision in the periphery have been done at eccentricities below 10and have used relatively articial stimuli such as letters, digits and compound Gabor patterns.  Little is known about how such data would apply in the case of more naturalistic stimuli.  Here humans were required to categorize briey ashed (28 ms) unmasked photographs of natural scenes (39high, and 26across) on the basis of whether or not they contained an animal.  The photographs appeared randomly in nine locations across virtually the entire extent of the horizontal visual eld.  Accuracy was 93. 3% for central vision and decreased almost linearly with increasing eccentricity
