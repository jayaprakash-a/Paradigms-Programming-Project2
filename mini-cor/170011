Classification of EEG Signals Using a Sparse Polynomial Builder
 Abstract Sutton and Matheus' algorithm for sparse polynomial construction is used to construct a classifier to recognize a mental task from recorded EEG signals.  Data used is from Keirn [Keirn 88].  Since the data set is very limited, the classification accuracy was calculated by the jack knife or loom method of cross validation.  Results indicate that the classifier does not generalize well on untrained data; accuracy averaged only 65%.  This was believed to be the result of having too many features, initially causing over fitting.  Since the algorithm starts with the features and only add news ones, initial over fitting remains.  To overcome this limitation, the polynomial was modified to have zero features initially.  On average the classification accuracy was unimproved, although most subjects' accuracy was 10 to 20% higher.  The low accuracy is speculated to be the result of bad feature selection and the algorithm's susceptibility to noisy output and incomplete sampling of patterns.  One result of this project is a reusable and modular set of C++ classes for training classifiers based on Sutton and Matheus' method.
