Learning to Extract Symbolic Knowledge from the World Wide Web
 Abstract The World Wide Web is a vast source of information accessible to computers, but understandable only to humans.  The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web.  Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledgebased inference and problem solving.  Our approachistodevelop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations.  Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web.  This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system.
