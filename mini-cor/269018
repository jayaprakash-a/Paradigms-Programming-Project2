Position Encoding Dynamic Trees for Image Sequence Analysis
 Abstract Position Encoding Dynamic Trees have been demonstrated to be useful models for individual images.  In the theory and experiments presented here, we show that the PEDT models can be used for the analysis of ordered sequences of images.  We provide a theoretical framework in which to update the current prior model sequentially using the variational approximation to the posterior probability distribution from the previous time frame.  We present experimental results demonstrating improved segmentation performance using the new approach.
