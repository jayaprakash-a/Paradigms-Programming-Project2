Advances in Cooperative Multi-Sensor Video Surveillance
 Abstract Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Sarnoff Corporation (Sarnoff) are performing an integrated feasibility demonstration of Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM).  The objective is to develop a cooperative, multi-sensor video surveillance system that provides continuous coverage over battlefield areas.  Significant achievements have been demonstrated during VSAM Demo I in November 1997, and in the intervening year leading up to Demo II in October 1998.
