Real Time Motion Analysis Toward Semantic Understanding of Video Content
 ABSTRACT Video motion analysis and its applications have been a classic research topic for decades.  In this paper, we explore the problem of real time video semantics understanding based on motion information.  The work can be divided into two segments: global / camera motion estimation and object motion analysis.  The former involves optical flow analysis and semantic meaning parsing, and the latter involves object detection and tracking.  Although each of these topics has been studied extensively in the literature, a thorough system combining all of them without human intervention, especially under a real time application scenario, is still worthy of further investigation.  In this paper we develop our approach toward such a destination and propose an integral architecture.  The usability and efficiency of the proposed system have been demonstrated through experiments.  Results of this project have numerous applications in digital entertainment, such as video and image summarization, annotation, retrieval and editing.
