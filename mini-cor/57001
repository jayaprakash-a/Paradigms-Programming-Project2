The Existence of Predictive Complexity and the Legendre Transformation
 Abstract Predictive complexity is a generalisation of Kolmogorov complexity.  In this paper we point out some properties of predictive complexity connected with the Legendre (--Young--Fenchel) transformation.  Our main result is that mixability is necessary for the existence of conditional predictive complexity (it is known to be sufficient under very mild assumptions).  We formulate a differential criterion of mixability and show that it reduces to a very simple form if we employ the Legendre transformation.  The Legendre transformation also turns out to have a probabilistic meaning which allows us to prove that a variant of predictive complexity specifies a unique (up to a parametrisation) mixable game.
