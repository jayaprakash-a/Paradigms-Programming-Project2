Detection of change in shape: an advantage for concavities
 Abstract Shape representation was studied using a change detection task.  Observers viewed two individual shapes in succession, either identical or one a slightly altered version of the other, and reported whether they detected a change.  We found a dramatic advantage for concave compared to convex changes of equal magnitude.  Observers were more accurate when a concavity along the contour was introduced, or removed, compared to a convexity.  This result sheds light on the underlying representation of visual shape, and in particular the central role played by part-boundaries.  Moreover, this finding shows how change detection methodology can serve as a useful tool in studying the specific form of visual representations.
