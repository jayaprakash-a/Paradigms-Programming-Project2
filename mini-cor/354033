Using Randomized Sparsification to Approximate Minimum Cuts
 Abstract We introduce the concept of randomized sparsification of a weighted, undirected graph.  Randomized sparsification yields a sparse unweighted graph which closely approximates the minimum cut structure of the original graph.  As a consequence, we show that a cut of weight within a (1 + ffl) multiplicative factor of the minimum cut in a graph can be found in O(m + n(log 3 n)=ffl 4 ) time; thus any constant factor approximation can be achieved in ~ O(m) time.  Similarly, we show that a cut within a multiplicative factor of ff of the minimum can be found in RNC using m + n 2=ff processors.  We also investigate a parametric version of our randomized sparsification approach.  Using it, we show that for a graph undergoing a series of edge insertions and deletions, an O( p 1 + 2=ffl)-approximation to the minimum cut value can be maintained at a cost of ~ O(n ffl+1=2 ) time per insertion or deletion.  If only insertions are allowed, the approximation can be maintained at a cost of ~ O(n ffl ) time per insertion.
