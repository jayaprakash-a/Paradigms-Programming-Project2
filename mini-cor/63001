PRONUNCIATION MODELING USING A FINITE-STATE TRANSDUCER REPRESENTATION
 ABSTRACT The MIT SUMMIT speech recognition system models pronunciation using a phonemic baseform dictionary along with rewrite rules for modeling phonological variation and multi-word reductions.  Each pronunciation component is encoded within a finitestate transducer (FST) representation whose transition weights can be probabilistically trained using a modified EM algorithm for finite-state networks.  This paper explains the modeling approach we use and the details of its realization.  We demonstrate the benefits and weaknesses of the approach both conceptually and empirically using the recognizer for our JUPITER weather information system.  Our experiments demonstrate that the use of phonological rewrite rules within our system reduces word error rates by between 4% and 8% over different test sets when compared against a system using no phonological rewrite rules.
