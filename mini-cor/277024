 Learning low-level vision.  Abstract We show a learning-based method for low-level vision problems.  We set-up a Markov network of patches of the image and the underlying scene.  A factorization approximation allows us to easily learn the parameters of the Markov network from synthetic examples of image/scene pairs, and to efficiently propagate image information.  Monte Carlo simulations justify this approximation.  We apply this to the \super-resolution" problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results.  For the motion estimation problem, we show resolution of the aperture problem and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery.
