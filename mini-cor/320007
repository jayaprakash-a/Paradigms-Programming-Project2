A Resource Sensitive Interpretation of Lexical Functional Grammar
 Abstract.  This paper investigates whether the fundamental linguistic insights and intuitions of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), which is usually presented as a ``constraint-based" linguistic theory, can be reformulated in a "resource sensitive" framework using a substructural modal logic.  In the approach investigated here, LFG's f-descriptions are replaced with expressions from a multi-modal propositional logic (with permutation and possibly limited contraction).  In effect, the feature structure "unification" basis of LFG's f-structures is replaced with a very different resource based mechanism.  It turns out that some linguistic analyses that required non-monotonic devices in LFG (such as the "constraint equations" in the Andrews (1982) analysis of Icelandic) can be straightforwardly expressed in the framework presented here.  Moreover, a Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs in this logic and -terms provides a semantic interpretation as a by-product of the process of showing syntactic well-formedness.
