A continuous probabilistic framework for image matching
 Abstract In this paper we describe a probabilistic image matching scheme in whichtheimage representation is continuous, and the similarity measure and distance computation are also defined in the continuous domain.  Each image is first represented as a Gaussian mixture distribution and images are compared and matched via a probabilistic measure of similarity between distributions.  A common probabilistic and continuous framework is applied to the representation as well as the matching process, ensuring an overall system that is theoretically appealing.  Matching results are investigated and the application to an image retrieval system is demonstrated.
