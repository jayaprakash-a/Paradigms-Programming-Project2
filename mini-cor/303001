Workshop on Statistical Relational Learning and its Connections to Other Fields Workshop Co-chairs
 Preface This workshop is the third in a series of workshops held in conjunction with AAAI and IJCAI.  The first workshop was held in July, 2000 at AAAI.  Notes from that workshop are available at http://robotics. stanford. edu/srl/.  The second workshop was held in July, 2003 at IJCAI.  Notes from that workshop are available at http://kdl. cs. umass. edu/srl2003/ There has been a surge of interest in this area.  The efforts have been diffused across a wide collection of sub-areas in computer science including machine learning, database management, and theoretical computer science.  The goal of this year's workshop is to reach out to related fields that have not participated in previous workshops.  Specifically, we seek to invite researchers in computer vision, spatial statistics, social network analysis, language modeling, and probabilistic inference to attend the workshop and give tutorials on the relational learning problems and techniques developed in their fields.  These fields have many years of experience in particular kinds of relational learning, and we hope that bringing these diverse communities together, we can all achieve a better understanding of the range of problems and methods that can be brought to bear on relational learning problems.  We'd like to give a big THANK YOU to the program committee.  Looking forward to a lively and productive workshop in Banff.
