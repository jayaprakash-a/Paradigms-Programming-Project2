 ABSTRACT We present the two{point correlation function (2PCF) for narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected within the First Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  Using a sample of 13605 AGN in the redshift range 0:055 < z < 0:2, we find that the AGN auto{correlation function is consistent with the observed galaxy auto{correlation function on scales 0:2h 1 Mpc to } 100h 1 Mpc.  The AGN hosts trace an intermediate population of galaxies and are not detected in the bluest (youngest) disk{dominated galaxies or many of the reddest (oldest) galaxies.  We show that the AGN 2PCF is dependent on the luminosity of the narrow [OIII] emission line (L [OIII] ), with low L [OIII] AGN having a higher clustering amplitude than high L [OIII] AGN.  This is consistent with lower activity AGN residing in more massive galaxies than higher activity AGN, and L [OIII] providing a good indicator of the fueling rate.  Using an AGN model embedded in cosmological simulations, we show that AGN hosted by # 10 12 M# dark matter halos have a 2PCF that matches that of the observed sample.  This mass scale implies a mean black hole mass for the sample of MBH # 10 8 M# .
