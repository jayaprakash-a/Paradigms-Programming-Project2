Generation of Natural-Looking 3D Shapes by Simulated Evolution
 Abstract Diverse complex simulated objects are widely used in psychophysical study of visual recognition, in computer graphics, and in animation.  This paper describes a method to generate artificially objects belonging to a given subjectively characterized class.  The method uses artificial evolution and is based on the observation that humans may classify objects by comparing them with previously encountered structural prototypes.  An efficient artificial evolution algorithm was obtained using a thermodynamical point of view of the object universe, which regarded objects as populations of generic parts characterized by an entropy-like function used as fitness.  The object's evolution is driven by the prototypes, is locally controlled by the external conditions, and tends to maximize a measure of fitness which is analogous to entropy in the second law of thermodynamics.
