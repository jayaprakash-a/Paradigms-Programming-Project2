An integrated approach to bioprocess recipe design
 Finland Biotechnical and food process industries have a need for tools that support the implementation of modern manufacturing practice.  Flexible production strategies and total quality management require efficient design of the process recipes.  This paper presents the approach used in Sophist, an adaptive recipe planning system.  The system integrates casebased reasoning and a semi-qualitative process model for the design and optimisation of bioprocess recipes.  In particular, we introduce a novel revision selection algorithm that improve the system's adaptivity.  The behavior of the planner is exemplified by a batch fermentation planning experiment.
