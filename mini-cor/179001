2004 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium
 ABSTRACT Warfighter operational requirements for Joint tactical battle management and command and control (BM/C2) now reflect warfare capabilities required of networked interoperable systems, as opposed to the previous single-system orientation.  However, network-centric warfare won't realize full combat potential until the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition processes are geared toward developing system-of-systems materiel responses.  DoD acquisition processes for solving interoperability must be transformed from a system-system interface basis, which leads to an unworkably complex N 2 problem, to unprecedented (for DoD) holistic networked-system approaches.  Initial such thrusts at the DoD-enterprise level, e.
