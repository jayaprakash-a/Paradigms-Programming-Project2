Classifying Proteins as Extracellular using Programmatic Motifs and Genetic Programming
 Abstract As newly sequenced proteins are deposited into the world's ever-growing archive of protein sequences, they are typically immediately tested by various computerized algorithms for clues as to their biological structure and function.  One question about a new protein involves its cellular location -- that is, where the protein resides in a living organism (extracellular, intracellular, etc. ).  A 1997 paper reported a human-created five-way algorithm for cellular location created using statistical techniques with 76% accuracy.  This paper describes a two-way classification algorithm that was evolved using genetic programming with 83% accuracy for determining whether a protein is extracellular.  Unlike the statistical calculation, the genetically evolved algorithm employs a large and varied arsenal of computational capabilities,
