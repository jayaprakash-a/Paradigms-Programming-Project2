``Coaching" variables for regression and classification
 Abstract In a regression or classification setting where we wish to predict Y from x1 ; x2 ; .  .  .  xp , we suppose that an additional set of "coaching" variables z1 ; z2 ; .  .  .  zm are available in our training sample.  These might be variables that are difficult to measure, and they will not be available when we predict Y from x1 ; x2 ; .  .  .  xp in the future.  We consider two methods of making use of the coaching variables in order to improve the prediction of Y from x1 ; x2 ; .  .  .  xp .  The relative merits of these approaches are discussed and compared in a number of examples.
