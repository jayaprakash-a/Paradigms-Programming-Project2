Analog VLSI Implementations of Continuous-Time Memory Structures
 Abstract The continuous-time implementation of the popular transversal filter is problematic since it is impossible to implement an ideal time delay in continuous-time hardware.  We believe that building an ideal time delay would not be worthwhile anyway since the ideal time delay has shown to be inferior to lowpass (Gamma) and all-pass (Laguerre) stages in discrete-time simulations.  We demonstrate feedforward analog VLSI implementations of the Gamma and Laguerre memory structures and show measurements of their performance.  We also show through simulation of a system identification problem that the Laguerre filter is expected to converge faster and be more robust to the noise and offsets that we expect in an analog VLSI implementation.
