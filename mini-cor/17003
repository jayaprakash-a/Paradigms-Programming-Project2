COMPACT INTEGRATED TRANSCONDUCTANCE AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT FOR TEMPORAL DIFFERENTIATION
 ABSTRACT A compact integrated CMOS circuit for temporal differentiation is presented.  It consists of a high-gain inverting amplifier, an active non-linear transconductance and a capacitor and requires only 4 transistors in its minimal configuration.  The circuit provides two rectified current outputs that are proportional to the temporal derivative of the input voltage signal.  Besides the compactness of its design, the presented circuit is not dependent on the DC-value of the input signal, as compared with known integrated differentiator circuits [1].  Measured chip results show that the circuit operates on a large input frequency range for which it provides nearideal temporal differentiation.  The circuit is particularly suited for focal-plane implementations of gradient-based visual motion systems.  1.  MOTIVATION A critical constraint in focal-plane design is the compactness of the pixel.  Implementations of gradient-based motion estimation algorithms critically rely on the robust and exact estimation of spatio-temporal intensity gradients [2, 3, 4].  In elaborate 2D motion processing systems, the extraction of the temporal intensity gradient is only a fraction of the total signal processing performed in each pixel [5].  Compact circuits are favorable in order to reduce pixel sizes.
