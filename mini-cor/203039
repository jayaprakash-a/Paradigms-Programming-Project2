Duality and Auxiliary Functions for Bregman Distances
 Abstract We formulate and prove a convex duality theorem for Bregman distances and present a technique based on auxiliary functions for deriving and proving convergence of iterative algorithms to minimize Bregman distance subject to linear constraints.
