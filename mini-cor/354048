An NC Algorithm for Minimum Cuts
 Abstract We show that the minimum cut problem for weighted undirected graphs can be solved in NC using three separate and independently interesting results.  The first is an (m 2 =n)-processor NC algorithm for finding a (2 + ffl)-approximation to the minimum cut.  The second is a randomized reduction from the minimum cut problem to the problem of obtaining a (2 + ffl)-approximation to the minimum cut.  This reduction involves a natural combinatorial Set-Isolation Problem that can be solved easily in RNC.  The third result is a derandomization of this RNC solution that requires a combination of two widely used tools: pairwise independence and random walks on expanders.  We believe that the set-isolation approach will prove useful in other derandomization problems.  The techniques extend to two related problems: we describe NC algorithms finding minimum k-way cuts for any constant k and finding all cuts of value within any constant factor of the minimum.  Another application of these techniques yield an NC algorithm for finding a sparse kconnectivity certificate for all polynomially bounded values of k.  Previously, an NC construction was only known for polylogarithmic values of k.
