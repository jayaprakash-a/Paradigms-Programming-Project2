 Abstract Neuroscientists have long been interested in how e$ iently we solve probabilisti sensory problems.  In order to explore analogous questions in the motor domain, we observed the eye movements of human subje ts attempting to tra k a visual target whi h moved sto hasti ally a ross a omputer s reen.  The subje ts' behavior was then ompared to a mathemati allyderived bound on the best performan e possible in su h a task.  The subje ts were able to perform surprisingly near the optimum under the onditions examined.  These results onstitute an important step in determining the e$ ien y of the nervous system in the ontext of ongoing behavior.
