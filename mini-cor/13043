On the milliarcsecond scale structural properties of low and high redshift quasars
 We analyse VLBI data of a sample of radio quasars in order to study the milliarcsecond scale structural properties of quasars in the widest available redshift range of 0:2 ! z ! 4:5.  The statistical study is based on a combination of the 5 GHz Caltech-Jodrell VLBI survey and our data for a set of extremely high redshift sources.  We show that the apparently less prominent milliarcsecond scale structures found in z ? 3 quasars do not contradict the assumption of intrinsic similarity of radio sources at different redshifts and may be explained by a difference in spectral properties of cores and extended components (jets).
