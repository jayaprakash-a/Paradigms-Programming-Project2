Quantum Phase Transitions Outside the Wilson Landau Ginzburg Paradigm
 Abstract We review certain aspects of quantum phase transititions.  We then report on certain recent theoretical advances in the study of quantum phase transitions in the context of two dimensional quantum magnets, which do not fit into the Ginbzburg-Landau-Wilson (GLW) formalism usually used to study phase transitions.
