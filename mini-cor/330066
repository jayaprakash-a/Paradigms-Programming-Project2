Foraging through Uncertainty Using Predictive Hebbian learning
 ABSTRACT To survive, an animal must use sensory events to predict the presence of mates, food, danger, and various other stimuli.  We present a model which utilizes diffuse neuromodulatory systems to implement a predictive version of a Hebbian rule, and embed this rule in a feasible neural architecture.  The predictive model suggests a unified way in which neuromodulatory influences are used to bias actions and control synaptic plasticity, and offers a simple framework which is nonetheless more powerful than standard correlational accounts.  When required to forage in a stochastic environment, the model captures the strategies seen in the behavior of bees and a number of other animals.
