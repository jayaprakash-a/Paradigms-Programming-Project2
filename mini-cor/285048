On the Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes from Reference Views
 Abstract We consider a scene, containing many objects moving with constant velocity along straight line paths, seen from three reference viewpoints at three different times. The scene may even consist only of moving objects with no static features.  We wish to create a new image sequence showing the scene from arbitrary viewing position and arbitrary time.  We make use of a newly discovered tool, the "dual Htensor"[1], that connects together three views of a coplanar configuration of (unlabeled) static and moving points.  The newly synthesized images use constant velocity in the world to achive realistic and physically correct images.
