A Parametric Optimization Method for Machine Learning
 Abstract The classification problem of constructing a plane to separate the members of two sets can be formulated as a parametric bilinear program.  This approach was originally created to minimize the number of points misclassified.  However, a novel interpretation of the algorithm is that the subproblems represent alternative error functions of the misclassified points.  Each subproblem identifies a specified number of outliers and minimizes the magnitude of the errors on the remaining points.  A tuning set is used to select the best result among the subproblems.  A parametric Frank-Wolfe method was used to solve the bilinear subproblems.  Computational results on a number of datasets indicate that the results compare very favorably with linear programming and heuristic search approaches.  The algorithm can be used as part of a decision tree algorithm to create nonlinear classifiers.
