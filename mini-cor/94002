A Floating-Gate Trimmable High-Resolution DAC in Standard 0
25.  Abstract We have built a 14-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in a standard 0. 25m digital CMOS process.  We use analog values stored on floating-gate p-channel MOSFETs to trim the DAC linearity.  Because the storage is nonvolatile, we eliminate the need for continuous trimming.  Our design has 6 untrimmable LSBs and 8 trimmable MSBs.  The pre-trim differential nonlinearity (DNL) exceeded 130 LSBs; the post-trim DNL is less than 1. 8 LSBs.  We were able to trim the 8 MSBs to 0. 5 LSB DNL; the 1. 8 LSB error is due to an untrimmable bit.  Because our DAC does not require continuous trimming, nor laser-trimmable resistors, it occupies only 0. 17 mm 2 of die area and dissipates 11 mW at 100 MHz with a --10 dBm differential output.
