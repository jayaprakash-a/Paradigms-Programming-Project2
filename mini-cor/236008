Accounting for Growth in Post-Soviet Russia
 Abstract In pursuit of its transition from a command to a market economy, post-Soviet Russia has witnessed enormous regional differences in economic growth rates.  We find that these regional differences exhibit remarkable correspondence with the formation of new legal enterprises.  In turn, regional variations in the adoption of economic reforms appear to be an important factor in accounting for regional variations in new-enterprise formation.
