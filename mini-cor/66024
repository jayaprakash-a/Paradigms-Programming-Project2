Discriminative Variable Memory Markov Model for Feature Selection
 Abstract We propose a novel feature selection method, based on a variable memory Markov model (VMM).  The VMM was originally proposed as a generative model for language and handwriting[14], trying to preserve the original source statistics from training data.  Here we consider the VMM models for extracting discriminative statistics for hypotheses testing.  In this context one is provided training data for different sources and the goal is to build a model that preserve the most discriminative features between the sources.  We show that a new criterion should be used for pruning the non-discriminative features and propose a new algorithm for achieving that.  We demonstrate the new method on text and protein classification and show the validity and power of the method.
