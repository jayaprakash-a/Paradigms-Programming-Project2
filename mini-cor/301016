Rules and Similarity in Concept Learning
 Abstract A popular view holds that learning and generalizing concepts depends on two fundamentally distinct modes of representation: rules and similarityto-exemplars.  Through a combination of experiments and formal analysis, I show how a Bayesian framework offers a unifying account of both rule-based and similarity-based generalization.  Bayes explains the specific workings of these two modes -- which rules are abstracted, how similarity is measured -- as well as why generalization appears rule-based or similarity-based in different situations.  I conclude that the distinction between rules and similarity in concept learning may be useful at the level of heuristic algorithms, but is not computationally fundamental.
