MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC RESEARCH LABORATORIES CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH CENTER Orientation Histograms for Hand Gesture Recognition
 Abstract We present a method to recognize hand gestures, based on a pattern recognition technique developed by McConnell [16] employing histograms of local orientation.  We use the orientation histogram as a feature vector for gesture class#cation and interpolation.  This method is simple and fast to compute, and offers some robustness to scene illumination changes.  We have implemented a real-time version, which can distinguish a small vocabulary of about 10 different hand gestures.  All the computation occurs on a workstation; special hardware is used only to digitize the image.  A user can operate a computer graphic crane under hand gesture control, or play a game.  We discuss limitations of this method.  For moving or \dynamic gestures", the histogram of the spatio-temporal gradients of image intensity form the analogous feature vector and may be useful for dynamic gesture recognition.
