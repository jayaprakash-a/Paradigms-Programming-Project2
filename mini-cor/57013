A Criterion for the Existence of Predictive Complexity for Binary Games
 Abstract It is well known that there exists a universal (i. e. , optimal to within an additive constant if allowed to work infinitely long) algorithm for lossless data compression (Kolmogorov, Levin).  The game of lossless compression is an example of an on-line prediction game; for some other on-line prediction games (such as the simple prediction game) a universal algorithm is known not to exist.  In this paper we give an analytic characterization of those binary on-line prediction games for which a universal prediction algorithm exists.
