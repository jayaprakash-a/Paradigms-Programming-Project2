A Joint Model for Semantic Role Labeling
 Abstract We present a semantic role labeling system submitted to the closed track of the CoNLL-2005 shared task.  The system, introduced in (Toutanova et al. , 2005), implements a joint model that captures dependencies among arguments of a predicate using log-linear models in a discriminative re-ranking framework.  We also describe experiments aimed at increasing the robustness of the system in the presence of syntactic parse errors.  Our final system achieves F1-Measures of 76. 68 and 78. 45 on the development and the WSJ portion of the test set, respectively.
