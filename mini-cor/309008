Discretion in Executive Incentive Contracts
 Abstract We examine the role of discretion in executive incentive contracts.  We consider the costs and benefits of using subjective performance evaluation of executives relative to objective performance measures.  We formulate hypotheses based on the theoretical work on discretionary compensation and test these hypotheses empirically using a proprietary dataset of executive bonus plans.  We show that discretion is less important in determining CEO pay than the pay of other executives.  We also find that discretion is relatively important in determining executive bonuses at larger and privately held firms and that more diversified firms are relatively less likely to compensate their business unit managers based on firm-wide performance.  Finally, we consider (and largely dismiss) tax-related explanations for our results.  * We are grateful to Towers Perrin for allowing access to their proprietary data on management bonus plans.
