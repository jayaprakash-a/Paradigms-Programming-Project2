Illustrating smooth surfaces
 Abstract We present a new set of algorithms for line-art rendering of smooth surfaces.  We introduce an efficient, deterministic algorithm for finding silhouettes based on geometric duality, and an algorithm for segmenting the silhouette curves into smooth parts with constant visibility.  These methods can be used to find all silhouettes in real time in software.  We present an automatic method for generating hatch marks in order to convey surface shape.  We demonstrate these algorithms with a drawing style inspired by A Topological Picturebook by G.  Francis.
