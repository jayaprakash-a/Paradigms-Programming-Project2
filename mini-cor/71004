General and Efficient Multisplitting of Numerical Attributes
 Abstract.  Often in supervised learning numerical attributes require special treatment and do not fit the learning scheme as well as one could hope.  Nevertheless, they are common in practical tasks and, therefore, need to be taken into account.  We characterize the well-behavedness of an evaluation function, a property that guarantees the optimal multi-partition of an arbitrary numerical domain to be defined on boundary points.  Well-behavedness reduces the number of candidate cut points that need to be examined in multisplitting numerical attributes.  Many commonly used attribute evaluation functions possess this property; we demonstrate
