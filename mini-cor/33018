Mobile Agent Interoperability Patterns and Practice
 Abstract A major setback for mobile agent technology is a lack of interoperability between systems for mobile agents which prevents them from reaching "critical mass".  In this paper, we analyze the requirements for interoperability, and present design patterns which support interoperability between systems for mobile agents.  We tested our patterns by adding support for Jade agents as well as for Tracy agents within our own mobile agent server SeMoA.  The results of our experiments and our conclusions are summarized.
