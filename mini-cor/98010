An Algorithm for Synaptic Modification Based on Exact Timing of Pre- and Post-Synaptic Action Potentials
 Abstract.  The timing between individual pre- and post-synaptic action potentials is known to play a crucial role in the modification of the synaptic efficacy during activity.  Based on stimulation protocols of two synaptically connected neurons, we infer an algorithm which explains the data by modifying the probability of neurotransmitter discharge as a function of the pre- and postsynaptic spikedelays.  The characteristics of this algorithm is its asymmetry with respect to the delays: if the postsynaptic spike arrives after the presynaptic spike, the probabilityof discharge is up-regulated while it is down-regulated if the postsynaptic spike arrives before the presynaptic spike.  The algorithm allows to predict stimulation protocols which induce maximal up- and down-regulation of the discharge probability.
