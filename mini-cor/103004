THE SRI MARCH 2000 HUB-5 CONVERSATIONAL SPEECH TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEM
 ABSTRACT We describe SRI's large vocabulary conversational speech recognition system as used in the March 2000 NIST Hub-5E evaluation.  The system performs four recognition passes: (1) bigram recognition with phone-loop-adapted, within-word triphone acoustic models, (2) lattice generation with transcription-mode-adapted models, (3) trigram lattice recognition with adapted cross-word triphone models, and (4) N-best rescoring and reranking with various additional knowledge sources.  The system incorporates two new kinds of acoustic model: triphone models conditioned on speaking rate, and an explicit joint model of within-word phone durations.  We also obtained an unusually large improvement from modeling crossword pronunciation variants in "multiword" vocabulary items.  The languagemodel (LM) was enhanced with an "anti-LM" representing acoustically confusable word sequences.  Finally, we applied a generalized ROVER algorithm to combine the N-best hypotheses from several systems based on different acoustic models.
