Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition
 Abstract--Multilayer Neural Networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful Gradient-Based Learning technique.  Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing.  This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task.  Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques.
