To appear in NEURAL COMPUTATION Elastic Net Model of Ocular Dominance: Overall Stripe Pattern and Monocular Deprivation
 Abstract The elastic net [Durbin & Willshaw 1987] can account for the development of both topography and ocular dominance in the mapping from the lateral geniculate nucleus to primary visual cortex [Goodhill & Willshaw 1990].  Here it is further shown for this model that (a) the overall pattern of stripes produced is strongly influenced by the shape of the cortex: in particular stripes with a global order similar to that seen biologically can be produced under appropriate conditions, and (b) the observed changes in stripe width associated with monocular deprivation are reproduced in the model.
