Presence research and EEG
 Summary The fields of presence research and electroencephalography (EEG) are related in, at least, two ways.  Firstly, EEG can be used to analyse the neurophysiological phenomena related to presence research.  For example, EEG might be useful to investigate the question of `breaks in presence'.  Secondly, EEG can be used to control external devices with a so-called "brain computer interface" (BCI).  Such a BCI might be also used for controlling a virtual environment.  The basic properties of EEG and the state-of-the art of BCI research are reviewed.  An experiment with EEG-based feedback was performed and the amount of transferred information is presented.  Some consequences for using EEG in presence research are discussed.
