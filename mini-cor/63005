LEXICAL MODELING OF NON-NATIVE SPEECH FOR AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION
 ABSTRACT This paper examines the recognition of non-native speech in jupiter, a speaker-independent, spontaneous-speech conversational system.  Because the non-native speech in this domain is limited and varied, speaker- and accent-specific methods are impractical.  We therefore chose to model all of the non-native data with a single model.  In particular, this paper describes an attempt to better model non-native lexical patterns.  These patterns are incorporated by applying context-independent phonetic confusion rules, whose probabilities are estimated from training data.  Using this approach, the word error rate on a non-native test set is reduced from 20. 9% to 18. 8%.
