On Exploiting Occlusions in Multiple-view Geometry
 Abstract Occlusions are commonplace in man-made and natural environments; they often result in photometric features where a line terminates at an occluding boundary, resembling a "T".  We show that the 2-D motion of such Tjunctions in multiple views carries non-trivial information on the 3-D structure of the scene and its motion relative to the camera.  We show how the constraint among multiple views of T-junctions can be used to reliably detect them and differentiate them from ordinary point features.  Finally, we propose an integrated algorithm to recursively and causally estimate structure and motion in the presence of T-junctions along with other point-features.
