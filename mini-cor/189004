Approximate Dynamic Programming via Linear Programming
 Abstract The curse of dimensionality gives rise to prohibitive computational requirements that render infeasible the exact solution of large{scale stochastic control problems.  We study an ecient method based on linear programming for approximating solutions to such problems.  The approach \#ts" a linear combination of pre{selected basis functions to the dynamic programming cost{to{go function.  We develop bounds on the approximation error and present experimental results in the domain of queueing network control, providing empirical support for the methodology.
