Isotopomer distribution computation from tandem mass spectrometric data with overlapping fragment spectra
 In tests with isotope-labelled alanine, most accurate results were obtained using multiple reaction monitoring and 15 eV collision energy.  The meausured isotopomer frequecies were in the range 99--106% of the theoretical value and the deviation between repetitions was in the range 1--10%.
