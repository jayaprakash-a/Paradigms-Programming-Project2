CPC2 PLATE REDUCTIONS WITH HIPPARCOS STARS: FIRST RESULTS
 ABSTRACT The Second Cape Photographic Catalog (CPC2) contains 276 131 stars covering the entire Southern Hemisphere in a 4{fold overlap pattern of 5687 plates.  New plate reductions using Hipparcos stars have been done.  The formal error of a Hipparcos star position at the mean epoch of the CPC2 (1968) is about 30 mas per coordinate, which is small compared to the x,y measuring precision.  A standard error of unit weight of 90 mas has been obtained for an average plate solution as compared to 141 mas for the earlier solution based on the Southern Reference Stars (SRS).  The same systematic field distortion patterns have been found in both solutions, but only the Hipparcos reference stars allow solving for magnitude dependent, systematic errors on a plate by plate basis.  Using the Hipparcos Catalogue considerably improves the accuracy of the final CPC2, which is estimated to be about 45 mas per coordinate when reductions, including a global block adjustment, are completed later this year.  Without significant systematic errors, this improved CPC2 will be a key catalogue for proper motion determinations of 9 to 11 magnitude stars in the Southern Hemisphere.
