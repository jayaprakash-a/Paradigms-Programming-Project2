USING THE FISHER KERNEL METHOD FOR WEB AUDIO CLASSIFICATION
 ABSTRACT As the multimedia contentoftheWeb increases techniques to automatically classify this content become more important.  In this paper we present a system to classify audio files collected from the Web.  The system classifies any audio file as belonging to one of three categories: `speech', `music' and `other'.  To classify the audio files, we use the technique of Fisher kernels.  The technique as proposed by Jaakkola assumes a probabilistic generative model for the data, in our case a Gaussian mixture model.  Then a discriminative classifier uses the GMM as an intermediate step to produce appropriate feature vectors.  Support Vector Machines are our choice of discriminative classifier.  We present classification results on a collection of more than 173 hours of Web audio randomly collected.  Webelieve our results represent one of the first realistic studies of audio classification performance on "found" data.  Our final system yielded a classification rate of 81. 8%.
