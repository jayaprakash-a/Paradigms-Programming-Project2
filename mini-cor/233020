AT&T at TREC-8
 Abstract In 1999, AT&T participated in the ad-hoc task and the Question Answering (QA), Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR), and Web tracks.  Most of our effort for TREC-8 focused on the QA and SDR tracks.  Results from SDR track show that our document expansion techniques, presented in [8, 9], are very effective for speech retrieval.  The results for question answering are also encouraging.  Our system designed in a relatively short period for this task can find the correct answer for about 45% of the user questions.  This is specially good given the fact that our system extracts only a short phrase as an answer.
