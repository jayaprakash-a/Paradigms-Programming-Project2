Nonlinear modelling of FES-supported standing up in paraplegia for selection of feedback sensors
 Abstract This paper presents analysis of the standing--up manoeuvre in paraplegia considering the body supportive forces as a potential feedback source in FES-assisted standing--up.  The analysis investigates the significance of particular feedback signals to the human body centre-of-mass (COM) trajectory reconstruction.  Two nonlinear empirical modeling methods are implemented (Gaussian process priors (GP) and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (ANN)) and their performance compared regarding the different amount of input information required.  The GP provided a better fit to the data, at higher computational cost.  The main objective of the study was to compare the different sensory configurations, trading off modelling performance for variables chosen, which allow ease-ofuse in everyday application.  In this manner, the results provide guidance for the design of user-friendly sensory-supported FES systems providing standing and standing-up in spinal cord injured persons.
