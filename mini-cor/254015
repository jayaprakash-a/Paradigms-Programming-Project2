Estimating the Spectral Envelope of Voiced Speech Using Multi-frame Analysis
 Abstract This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating the spectral envelope of voiced speech independently of its harmonic structure.  Because of the quasi-periodicity of voiced speech, its spectrum indicates harmonic structure and only has energy at frequencies corresponding to integral multiples of F0 .  It is hence impossible to identify transfer characteristics between the adjacent harmonics.  In order to resolve this problem, Multiframe Analysis (MFA) is introduced.  The MFA estimates a spectral envelope using many portions of speech which are vocalised using the same vocal-tract shape.  Since each of the portions usually has a different F0 and ensuing different harmonic structure, a number of harmonics can be obtained at various frequencies to form a spectral envelope.  The method thereby gives a closer approximation to the vocal-tract transfer function.
