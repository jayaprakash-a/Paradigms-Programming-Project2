ALONZO CHURCH'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHILOSOPHY AND INTENSIONAL LOGIC
 0.  Alonzo Church's contributions to philosophy and to that most philosophical part of logic, intensional logic, are impressive indeed.  He wrote relatively few papers actually devoted to specifically philosophical issues, as distinguished from related technical work in logic.  Many of his contributions appear in reviews for The Journal of Symbolic Logic, 1 and it can hardly be maintained that one finds there a "philosophical system".  But there occur a clearly articulated and powerful methodology, terse arguments, often of "crushing cogency", 2 and philosophical observations of the first importance.  Many of the less formal philosophical contributions center around questions concerning meaning, but there are important clarifications and insights into matters of the epistemology and ontology of the sciences, especially the formal sciences.  1.  Methodology, epistemology, and ontology.  1. 1.  The logistic method.  Church's writings on philosophical matters exhibit an unwavering commitment to what he called the "logistic method".  3 The term did not catch on and now one would just speak of "formalization".  The use of these ideas is now so common and familiar among logicians
