Context-Specific Independence in Bayesian Networks
 Abstract Bayesiannetworks provide a languagefor qualitatively representing the conditional independence properties of a distribution.  This allows a natural and compact representation of the distribution, eases knowledge acquisition, and supports effective inference algorithms.  It is well-known, however, that there are certain independencies that we cannot capture qualitatively within the Bayesian network structure: independencies that hold only in certain contexts, i. e. , given a specific assignment of values to certain variables.  In this paper, we propose a formal notion of context-specific independence (CSI), based on regularities in the conditional probability tables (CPTs) at a node.  We present a technique, analogous to (and based on) d-separation, for determining when such independence holds in a given network.  We then focus on a particular qualitative representation scheme---tree-structured CPTs--for capturing CSI.  We suggest ways in which this representation can be used to support effective inference algorithms.  In particular, we present a structural decomposition of the resulting network which can improve the performance of clustering algorithms, and an alternative algorithm based on cutset conditioning.
