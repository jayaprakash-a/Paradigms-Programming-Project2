Augmenting Undirected Edge Connectivity in
 Abstract We give improved randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithms for undirected edge splitting and edge connectivity augmentation problems.  Our algorithms run in time ~ O(n 2 ) on n-vertex graphs, making them an ~ \Omega(m=n) factor faster than the best known deterministic ones on m-edge graphs.
