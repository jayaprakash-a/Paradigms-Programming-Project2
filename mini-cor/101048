Squaring the Circle in Panoramas
 Abstract Pictures taken by a rotating camera cover the viewing sphere surrounding the center of rotation.  Having a set of images registered and blended on the sphere what is left to be done, in order to obtain a flat panorama, is projecting the spherical image onto a picture plane.  This step is unfortunately not obvious -- the surface of the sphere may not be flattened onto a page without some form of distortion.  The objective of this paper is discussing the difficulties and opportunities that are connected to the projection from viewing sphere to image plane.  We first explore a number of alternatives to the commonly used linear perspective projection.  These are `global' projections and do not depend on image content.  We then show that multiple projections may coexist successfully in the same mosaic: these projections are chosen locally and depend on what is present in the pictures.  We show that such multi-view projections can produce more compelling results than the global projections.
