SEEMORE: A View-Based Approach to 3-D Object Recognition Using Multiple Visual Cues
 Abstract A neurally-inspired visual object recognition system is described called seemore, whose goal is to identify common objects from a large known set---independent of 3-D viewing angle, distance, and non-rigid distortion.  seemore's database consists of 100 objects that are rigid (shovel), non-rigid (telephone cord), articulated (book), statistical (shrubbery), and complex (photographs of scenes).  Recognition results were obtained using a set of 102 color and shape feature channels within a simple feedforward network architecture.  In response to a test set of 600 novel test views (6 of each object) presented individually in color video images, seemore identified the object correctly 97% of the time (chance is 1%) using a nearest neighbor classifier.  Similar levels of performance were obtained for the subset of 15 non-rigid objects.  Generalization behavior reveals emergence of striking natural category structure not explicit in the input feature dimensions.
