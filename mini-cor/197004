Running Head: VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MODELING PFC Using a Virtual Environment to Assess the Ecological Validity of a Model of Prefrontal Cortex
 Abstract A computational model of prefrontal cortex is presented.  This model has been previously assessed in the context of a number of laboratory tasks, but concerns over the ability of this model to scale to ecologically valid situations remain.  Initial efforts to address these concerns are described, involving the embedding of the model in a simulated virtual environment, allowing the model to be assessed under conditions of rich sensory experience and complex reward contingencies.
