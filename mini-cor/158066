Chapter 1 Broadcast in Radio Networks
 Abstract We show that for any radio network there exists a schedule of a broadcast whose time is O(D + log 5 (n)), where D is the diameter and n is the number of nodes.  (This result implies an optimal broadcast to networks with D = \Omega(log 5 n). ) We present a (centralized) polynomial time algorithm that given a network and a source, outputs a schedule for broadcasting the message from the source to the rest of the network.
