Service Sockets: Design, Implementation and Interfaces
 Abstract As network services have evolved, their communication structures have become increasingly complex.  This increase in the complexity in the communication structure of services is mirrored by an increase in the complexity of the client code that interacts with and administers these services.  In this paper, we propose the Service Socket abstraction.  Conceptually, a Service Socket (or an S-socket) is a communication channel to a service instead of a particular host.  Service Sockets abstract away the details of interacting with complex and dynamic services while retaining the conceptual simplicity, the familiar programming interface and the ease-of-
