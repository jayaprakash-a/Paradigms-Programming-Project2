Multiple Relational Embedding
 Abstract We introduce a way to learn a low-dimensional embedding of data that is constrained by knowledge in the form of multiple different types of similarity relations.  Our method finds different, possibly overlapping, representations by individually reweighting the dimensions of a common underlying latent space.  When applied to a single similarity relation that is based on Euclidean distances between the input data points, the method reduces to simple dimensionality reduction.  In the case that additional information is available about the data set or about subsets of it, it allows us to use this information to clean up or otherwise improve the embedding.  We demonstrate the potential usefulness of this form of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction on a few simple examples.
