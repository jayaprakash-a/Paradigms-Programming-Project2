A Neuromorphic VLSI Device for Implementing 2-D Selective Attention Systems
 Abstract---Selective attention is a mechanism used to sequentially select and process salient subregions the input space, while suppressing inputs arriving from nonsalient regions.  By processing small amounts of sensory information serial fashion, rather than attempting to process all the sensory data in parallel, this mechanism overcomes the problem flooding limited processing capacity systems with sensory inputs.  It is found in many biological systems and can useful engineering tool for developing artificial systems that need to process in real-time sensory data.  In this paper we present neuromorphic hardware model of a selective attention mechanism implemented on very large scale integration (VLSI) chip, using analog circuits.  The chip makes use of spike-based representation for receiving input signals, transmitting output signals and for shifting the selection of the attended input stimulus over time.  It can be interfaced to neuromorphic sensors and actuators, for implementing multichip selective attention systems.  We describe the characteristics the circuits used in the architecture and present experimental data measured from the system.
