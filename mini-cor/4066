Phase and Amplitude Control Ability using Spatial Light Modulators and Zero Path Length Difference Michelson Interferometer
 ABSTRACT A new method is presented for amplitude and phase control using two liquid crystal spatial light modulators in conjunction with a white light Michelson interferometer.  Preliminary proof-of-concept measurements are given showing the prospect of using this method for correction of amplitude errors in telescopes.
