836 Final Project: Evolving XBattle Players.  Abstract Much of the success of Genetic Algorithms (GA) come in domains where the problem or solutions to the problem can be easily represented as a genome---a string of 1s and 0s or an array of parameter values.  Less success is reported in domains where solutions are not so easily representable.  Game playing, such as chess or go, is one such domain where it is difficult to represent the strategy for a player.  Here, we take upon ourselves that challenge and show that it is possible to evolve good game players in a domain where representation is a serious challenge.  XBattle is a real-time war strategy game where agile mouse control and quick wits are essential for any good player.  In this paper, we show the process needed for genetically evolving players for this game.  We describe the tradeoffs in representation design and evolve a number of different XBattle players, each with its unique and intersting characteristics.  Through this evolutionary process emerges some of the fundamentally important strategies necessary for being a successful XBattle player.
