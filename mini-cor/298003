Image Segmentation by Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo
 Abstract This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian statistical framework.  The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects.  Firstly, it designs ecient and well balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space, and thus achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations.  Secondly, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence, and thus it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation.  Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods[12, 11].  Fourthly, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities.  Thus the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way.  The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and non-parametric image models for intensity and color at various regions.  We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and grey level images, and some results are reported in this paper.
