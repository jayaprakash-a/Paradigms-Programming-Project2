Structural basis for triplet repeat disorders: a computational analysis
 Abstract Motivation: Over a dozen major degenerative disorders, including myototonic distrophy, Huntington's disease, and fragile X syndrome, result from unstable expansions of particular trinucleotides.  Remarkably, only some of all the possible triplets, namely CAG/CTG, CGG/CCG and GAA/TTC, have been associated with the known pathological expansions.  This raises some basic questions at the DNA level.  Why do particular triplets seem to be singled out? What is the mechanism for their expansion and how does it depend on the triplet itself? Could other triplets or longer repeats be involved in other diseases? Results: Using several different computational models of DNA structure, we show that the triplets involved in the pathological repeats generally fall into extreme classes.  Thus, CAG/CTG repeats are particularly flexible, whereas GCC, CGG and GAA repeats appear to display both flexible and rigid (but curved) characteristics depending on the method of analysis.  The fact that (1) trinucleotide repeats often become increasingly unstable when they exceed a length of approximately 50 repeats, and (2) repeated 12-mers display a similar increase in instability above 13 repeats, together suggest that approximately 150 bp is a general threshold length for repeat instability.  Since this is about the length of DNA wrapped up in a single nucleosome core particle, we speculate that chromatin structure may play an important role in the expansion mechanism.  We furthermore suggest that expansion of a dodecamer repeat, which we predict to have very high flexibility, may play a role in
