Learning Bayesian Nets that Perform Well
 Abstract A Bayesian net (BN) is more than a succinct way to encode a probabilistic distribution; it also corresponds to a function used to answer queries.  A BN can therefore be evaluated by the accuracy of the answers it returns.  Many algorithms for learning BNs, however, attempt to optimize another criterion (usually likelihood, possibly augmented with a regularizing term), which is independent of the distribution of queries that are posed.  This paper takes the "performance criteria" seriously, and considers the challenge of computing the BN whose performance --- read ``accuracy over the distribution of queries" --- is optimal.  We show that many aspects of this learning task are more difficult than the corresponding subtasks in the standard model.
