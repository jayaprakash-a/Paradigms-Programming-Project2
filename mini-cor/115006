Computational models of perceptual learning
 Abstract In visual perception, learning is a pervasive phenomenon, which, when properly studied, may offer valuable insights into the inner workings of the brain.  We outline a theoretical framework for the computational study of perceptual learning, aiming to make the relationships among the existing models more readily apparent, and to identify promising directions for future research.
