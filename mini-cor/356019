Imaging with THz Radiation
 ABSTRACT The terahertz or far-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum offers a vast array of non-destructive evaluation possibilities.  However, only over the last decade has progress in nonlinear optics and optoelectronics made it possible to efficiently generate and detect terahertz radiation for use in such applications.  As a result, these possibilities have not been exploited.  In this paper we first describe a novel technique for imaging with THz radiation.  Examples of "T-ray" images which illustrate the capabilities of this new technology are presented.  Then, we discuss recent results in 3D tomographic THz imaging.  In particular, we describe a new signal processing scheme for image reconstruction which uses cepstral analysis and wavelets.  We discuss other imaging work with THz radiation and applications for commercial use.
