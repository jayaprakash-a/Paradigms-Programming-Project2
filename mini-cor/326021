WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SEVER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO REAL-VALUED MULTIPLE-INSTANCE CLASSIFICATIONS
 The model of multiple-instance learning has recently arisen in the machine learning community as a new and important setting for several real-world problems, most notably drug design and discovery.  However, most work, both theoretical and empirical, has been aimed at classifying target objects in a Boolean, or binary, fashion.  Often we are more interested in quantitative (or at least comparative) measures for classifying targets.  This research examines a novel empirical method for real-valued classification of examples in machine learning.  We have devised a tunable offline algorithm that uses Bayesian probability theory to classify examples with a real-valued label on an interval, rather than a discrete label from a set.  We show how the algorithm performs in practice, describe some of its distinct advantages over a Boolean classification algorithm, and evaluate its promise as a new tool in the area of drug activity prediction.
