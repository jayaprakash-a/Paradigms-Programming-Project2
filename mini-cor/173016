Some similarity solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and related topics
 Abstract We consider a semilinear equation arising from the Navier-Stokes equations -the governing equations of viscous fluid motion -- and related model equations.  The solutions of the semilinear equation represent a certain class of exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  Both the equation and our models have non-local terms.  We will show that the non-locality will play an intriguing role for the blowup and/or global existence of the solutions and that the convection term, which is often neglected in the study of the blow-up problems, plays a very decisive role.  In addition to our new contributions, open problems and known facts are surveyed.
