Constructing small sample spaces satisfying given constraints
 Abstract Abstract.  The subject of this paper isfinding small sample spaces for joint distributions of n discrete random variables.  Such distributions are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form Pr(E)=.  We show that the problem of deciding whether there exists any distribution satisfying a given set of constraints isNP-15840 However, if the constraints are consistent, then there exists adistribution satisfying them which is supported by a "small" sample space (one whose cardinalityis equal to the number of constraints).  For the important case of independenceconstraints,where the constraints have a certain form and areconsistent with a joint distribution of n independent random variables, a small sample space can be constructed in polynomial time.  This last result is also useful for de-13848-2253 algorithms.  We demonstrate this technique by an application to the problem of finding large independentsetsin sparse hypergraphs.
