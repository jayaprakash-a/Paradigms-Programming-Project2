Learning Riemannian Metrics
 Abstract We consider the problem of learning a Riemannian metric associated with a given differentiable manifold and a set of points.  Our approach to the problem involves choosing a metric from a parametric family that is based on maximizing the inverse volume of a given dataset of points.  From a statistical perspective, it is related to maximum likelihood under a model that assigns probabilities inversely proportional to the Riemannian volume element.  We discuss in detail learning a metric on the multinomial simplex where the metric candidates are pull-back metrics of the Fisher information under a continuous group of transformations.  When applied to documents, the resulting geodesics resemble, but outperform, the TFIDF cosine similarity measure in classification.
