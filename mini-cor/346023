Planar Object Recognition using Projective Shape Representation
 Abstract We describe a model based recognition system, called LEWIS, for the identification of planar objects based on a projectively invariant representation of shape.  The advantages of this shape description include simple model acquisition (direct from images), no need for camera calibration or object pose computation, and the use of index functions.  We describe the feature construction and recognition algorithms in detail and provide an analysis of the combinatorial advantages of using index functions.  Index functions are used to select models from a model base and are constructed from projective invariants based on algebraic curves and a canonical projective coordinate frame.  Examples are given of object recognition from images of real scenes, with extensive object libraries.  Successful recognition is demonstrated despite partial occlusion by unmodelled objects, and realistic lighting conditions.
