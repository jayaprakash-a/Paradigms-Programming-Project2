Fast Stereo-Based Head Tracking for Interactive Environments
 Abstract We present a robust implementation of stereo-based head tracking designed for interactive environments with uncontrolled lighting.  We integrate fast face detection and drift reduction algorithms with a gradient-based stereo rigid motion tracking technique.  Our system can automatically segment and track a user's head under large rotation and illumination variations.  Precision and usability of our approach are compared with previous tracking methods for cursor control and target selection in both desktop and interactive room environments.
