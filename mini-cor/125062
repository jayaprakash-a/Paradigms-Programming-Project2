An Inference Model for Semantic Entailment in Natural Language
 Abstract Semantic entailment is the problem of determining if the meaning of a given sentence entails that of another.  This is a fundamental problem in natural language understanding that provides a broad framework for studying language variability and has a large number of applications.  This paper presents a principled approach to this problem that builds on inducing representations of text snippets into a hierarchical knowledge representation along with a sound optimization-based inferential mechanism that makes use of it to decide semantic entailment.  A preliminary evaluation on the PASCAL text collection is presented.
