 Abstract The design (synthesis) of an analog electrical circuit entails the creation of both the topology and sizing (numerical values) of all of the circuit's components.  There has previously been no general automated technique for automatically creating the design for an analog electrical circuit from a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior.  This paper shows how genetic programming can be used to automate the design of eight prototypical analog circuits, including a lowpass filter, a highpass filter, a bandstop filter, a tristate frequency discriminator circuit, a frequency-measuring circuit, a 60 dB amplifier, a computational circuit for the square root function, and a time-optimal robot controller circuit.
