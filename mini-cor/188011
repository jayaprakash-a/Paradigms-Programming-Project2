Tilt-Based Automatic Zooming and Scaling in Mobile Devices - A State-Space Implementation
 Abstract.  We provide a dynamic systems interpretation of the coupling of internal states involved in speed-dependent automatic zooming, and test our implementation on a text browser on a Pocket PC instrumented with an accelerometer.  The dynamic systems approach to the design of such continuous interaction interfaces allows the incorporation of analytical tools and constructive techniques from manual and automatic control theory.  We illustrate experimental results of the use of the proposed coupled navigation and zooming interface with classical scroll and zoom alternatives.
