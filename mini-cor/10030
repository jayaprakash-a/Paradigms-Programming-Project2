Learning Parameterized Models of Image Motion
 Abstract A framework for learning parameterized models of optical flow from image sequences is presented.  A class of motions is represented by a set of orthogonal basis flow fields that are computed from a training set using principal component analysis.  Many complex image motions can be represented by a linear combination of a small number of these basis flows.  The learned motion models may be used for opticalflow estimationand for model-based recognition.  For optical flow estimation we describe a robust, multi-resolution scheme for directly computing the parameters of the learned flow models from image derivatives.  As examples we consider learning motion discontinuities, non-rigid motion of human mouths, and articulated human motion.
