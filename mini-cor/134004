A Unified Information Extraction and Coding Network
 Abstract A new form of neural network is introduced which is shown to be capable of performing a topology preserving feature mapping.  The mapping is performed in 2 steps: firstly the network performs a Principal Component Analysis, and then secondly makes a coding of each Principal Component.  The network uses only simple Hebbian learning in each section and is characterised by simplicity, homogeneity, locality of information use and parallelism.  A biologically more plausible variation of the original model is shown to be capable of the same mapping but at a loss of some simplicity.
