Sucient Dimensionality Reduction - A novel analysis principle
 Abstract Data dimensionality reduction of empirical co-occurrence data is one of the most fundamental problems in unsupervised learning and complex data analysis.  One principled approach to this problem is to represent the data in low dimension with minimal loss of information contained in the original data.  In this paper we present a novel information theoretic principle and algorithm for extracting low dimensional representations, or feature-vectors, that approximately preserve the information in one variable about another.  Unlike previous work in this direction, here we do not cluster or quantize the variables, but rather extract continuous feature functions directly from the co-occurrence matrix, using a converging iterative projection algorithm.  Our approach is both simpler and more general than clustering techniques and proves effective in generating a very small feature set for document categorization.
