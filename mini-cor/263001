A network of chaotic elements for information processing
 Abstract A Globally Coupled Map (GCM) model is a network of chaotic elements that are globally coupled with each other.  In this paper, first, a modified GCM model called the "Globally Coupled Map using the Symmetric map (S-GCM)" is proposed.  The SGCM is designed for information-processing applications.  The S-GCM has attractors called "cluster frozen attractors," each of which is taken to represent information.  This paper also describes the following characteristics of the S-GCM which are important to information-processing applications: (a) The S-GCM falls into one of the cluster frozen attractors over a wide range of parameters.  This means that the information representation is stable over parameters; (b) Represented information can be preserved or broken by controlling parameters; (c) The cluster partitioning is restricted, i. e. , the representation of information has a limitation.  Finally, our techniques for applying the S-GCM to information processing are shown, considering these characteristics.  Two associative memory systems are proposed and their performance is compared with that of the Hopfield network.
