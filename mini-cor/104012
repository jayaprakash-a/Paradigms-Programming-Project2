A Computational Model of Cerebellar Learning for Limb Control \Lambda
 Abstract We present a model of cerebellar learning for control of limb movements.  The model learns to generate relatively smooth and direct arm movements, while not assuming (as some models do) a high-level input that specifies a preplanned trajectory.  The model controls a simulated two-joint arm, which is actuated by a set of six muscles.  Control of the arm is shared by a learning cerebellar module and a hard-wired extra-cerebellar (EC) system.  The cerebellar module consists of a group of independent submodules, referred to as Adjustable Pattern Generators (APGs).  Each APG is made up of a set of Purkinje cells and a single cerebellar nuclear cell.  Activation of an APG's nuclear cell drives a muscle synergy (a subset of the muscles).  The EC system is responsible for producing low-quality corrective movements in situations where the cerebellar module is unable to bring the arm to the specified target.  Via proprioceptive inputs, the modeled inferior olive assesses directional errors in cerebellar-generated movements by observing subsequent corrective movements produced by the EC system.
