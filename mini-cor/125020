IJCAI'05: A Poster Presentation An Inference Model for Semantic Entailment in Natural Language
 Semantic entailment is the problem of determining if the meaning of a given sentence entails that of another.  This is a fundamental problem in natural language understanding that provides a broad framework for studying language variability and has a large number of applications.  We present a principled approach to this problem that builds on inducing re-representations of text snippets into a hierarchical knowledge representation along with a sound inferential mechanism that makes use of it to prove semantic entailment.
