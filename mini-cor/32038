Spectrum of Pitch Differences Models the Perception of Octave Ambiguous Tones
 Abstract In the experiment we proof the paradoxical perception of pitch.  A tone sequence demonstrates this paradox: the sequence is perceived as descending, although the first and last tone are identical.  The intransitivity of pitch perception generalizes (Shepard 1964).  It applies also to harmonic complex tones with variate amplitude envelope and partials that are arranged in intervals different from octaves.  The paradox perception in this experiment as well as in the Shepard scale is modeled by a formula (spectrum of pitch differences) that extends the virtual pitch algorithm (Terhardt 1998) to pitch intervals.
