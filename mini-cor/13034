Detection and Tracking of Faces and Facial Features
 Abstract We describe a real-time system for face and facial feature detection and tracking in continuous video.  The core of this system consists of a set of novel facial feature detectors based on our previously proposed Information-Based Maximum Discrimination learning technique.  These classifiers are very fast and allow us to implement a fully automatic, real-time system for detection and tracking multiple faces.  In addition to locking onto up to four target faces, this system locates and tracks nine facial features as they move under facial expression changes.
