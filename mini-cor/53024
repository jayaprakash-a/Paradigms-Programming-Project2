Optimal Cluster Preserving Embedding of Non-Metric Proximity Data
 Abstract A new embedding method is introduced for clustering of pairwise data.  Pairwise data often violates metricity and, therefore, cannot be naturally embedded in a vector space.  Pairwise clustering methods take into account non metricity to yield a grouping solution based on all pairwise object relations.  We show that all cost-based pairwise methods sharing a certain shift invariance property can be reformulated as grouping problems in a Euclidian vector space, yielding identical assignments of objects to clusters.  This optimal embedding transforms the data in such a way that many vector based data mining algorithms become applicable, in particular denoising.
