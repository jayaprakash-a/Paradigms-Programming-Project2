APPLYING PRONUNCIATION MODELING TECHNIQUES TO FRENCH
 ABSTRACT This paper describes the use of data-driven pronunciation modeling techniques to substantially reduce error in a large vocabulary hybrid ANN/HMM speech recognition system for French.  Pronunciations from canonical transcriptions are combined with pronunciations from a text-to-speech system.  Forced alignments are used to calculate pronunciations' probabilities and to eliminate bad pronunciations.  Phonetic rules are used to smooth probabilities and ensure the inclusion of pronunciations that may not be present in the training data.  Issues concerning the choice of phonemes for the system are also discussed.
