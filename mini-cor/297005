Easy and Hard Testbeds for Real-Time Search Algorithms
 Abstract Although researchers have studied which factors influence the behavior of traditional search algorithms, currently not much is known about how domain properties influence the performance of real-time search algorithms.  In this paper we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that Eulerian state spaces(a supersetof undirected state spaces)are very easy for some existing real-time search algorithms to solve: even real-time search algorithms that can be intractable, in general, are efficient for Eulerian state spaces.  Because
