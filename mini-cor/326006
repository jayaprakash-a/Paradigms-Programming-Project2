Noise-Tolerant Distribution-Free Learning of General Geometric Concepts
 Abstract We present an efficient algorithm for PAC-learning a very general class of geometric concepts over ! d for fixed d.  More specifically, let T be a set of s halfspaces.  Let x = (x 1 ; : : : ; x d ) be an arbitrary point in ! d .  With each t 2 T we associate a boolean indicator function I t (x) which is 1 if and only if x is in the halfspace t.  The concept class, C d s , that we study consists of all concepts formed by any boolean function over I t 1 ; : : : ; I t s for t i 2 T where T is any set of s halfspaces.  The concept class we study here is much more general than any geometric concept class known to be PAC-learnable.  As special cases of our main result, we obtain learning algorithms for several new geometric concept classes.  While we consider geometric concepts defined by halfspaces, any polyhedron (not necessarily convex) defined by f faces can be formed by combining f halfspaces.  Thus our algorithm can also learn any boolean combination of a polynomial number of polyhedra each with a polynomial number of faces.  Even further, our results can be easily extended to efficiently learn any boolean combination of a polynomial number of concepts selected from any concept class C given that the VC-dimension of C is constant (for d constant) and there is a polynomial time algorithm to determine if there is a concept from C consistent with a given set of points.  We also present a statistical query version of our algorithm that can tolerate random classification noise for any noise rate strictly less than 1/2.  Finally we present a generalization of the standard ffl-net result of Haussler and Welzl [22] and apply it to give an alternative noise-tolerant algorithm for d = 2 based on geometric subdivisions.
