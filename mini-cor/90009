Deconstructing Motion
 Abstract In this paper, we use the Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of video sequences of human motion.  The LLE algorithm is a fast dimensionality reduction algorithm that finds local geometry in high dimensional space, and produces a projection to low dimensional space which preserves the original local geometry.  We implement both the original algorithm and its on-line variant, and demonstrate its performance on human walking motion.  Section 1 introduces the problem and the intuition behind the algorithm.  Section 2 describes the algorithm and its implementation in detail.  Section 3 presents experimental results.  Section 4 involves the on-line variant of LLE.  We conclude with suggestions for future work.
