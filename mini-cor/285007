Tensorial Transfer: Representation of N ? 3 Views of 3D scenes \Lambda
 Abstract The recently discovered "trilinear tensor" has been shown to play a similar role to the "fundamental" matrix, but with three views instead of two views, in representing the relative motion parameters of an observer moving in the 3D projective world.  The issue of a general representation for any number of views remains an open problem.  The main result presented here is the closed-form concatenation of any number of views.  The concatenation operation shows that N tensors are sufficient for representing a set of N +2 views, i. e. , the tensor of any triplet of views from the set can be generated in closedform from an arbitrary collection of N tensors over this set.  These concatenation operators may be useful in the context of image synthesis, image mosaicing and video compression.
