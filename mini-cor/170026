Reinforcement Learning with Modular Neural Networks for Control
 Abstract Reinforcement learning methods can be appliedto control problems with the objective of optimizing the value of a function over time.  They have been used to train single neural networks that learn solutions to whole tasks.  Jacobs and Jordan [5] have shown that a set of expert networks combined via a gating network can more quickly learn tasks that can bedecomposed.  Even the decomposition can belearned.  Inspiredby Boyan's work of modular neural networks for learning with temporal-di#erence methods [4], we modify the reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-Learning to train a modular neural network to solve a control problem.  The resulting algorithm is demonstratedonthe classical pole-balancing problem.  The advantage of such a method is that it makes it possible to deal with complex dynamic control problem effectively by using task decomposition and competitive learning.
