ON THE DEGRE OF L 1 -APROXIMATION BY MODIFIED BERNSTEIN POLYNOMIALS
 Abstract.  Recently many researchers like Bojani#c & Shisha, and A.  Grundmann have obtained the degree of L 1 approximation to integrable functions by modified Bernstein polynomials.  The object of the present note is to improve their results.
