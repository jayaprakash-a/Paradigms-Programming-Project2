A Robust and Efficient Method to Unwrap MR Phase Images
 SYNOPSIS Phase unwrapping finds many important applications in MRI, ranging from field mapping to flow imaging.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 2-D phase unwrapping, which models the true phase as a Gaussian Markov random field.  The phase is unwrapped using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) rule.  The underlying optimization problem is solved using a two-dimensional dynamic programming algorithm, which is efficient and robust to noise.  The proposed algorithm has been tested using various MRI data (acquired using spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences), yielding excellent phase maps.
