UNSUPERVISED SEMANTIC INTENT DISCOVERY FROM CALL LOG ACOUSTICS
 ABSTRACT Unforeseen user intents can account for a significant portion of unsuccessful calls in an automatic voice response system.  Discovering these unforeseen semantic intents usually requires expensive manual transcriptions.  We propose a method to cluster the acoustics from logged calls by their estimated semantic intents.  This is achieved through training a mixture of language models in an unsupervised manner.  Each cluster is presented to the application developer with a suggested language model to cover the semantic intent of the data in that cluster.  The application developer validates the cluster and its suggested language model, and then updates the application.  A quantative evaluation on a corporate voice-dialer application shows that updating the application in this manner yields a relative 13. 4% reduction in semantic error rate.
