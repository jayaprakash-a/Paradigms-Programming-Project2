Generalization Bounds for Function Approximation from Scattered Noisy Data
 We consider the problem of approximating functions from scattered data using linear superpositions of non-linearly parameterized functions.  We show how the total error (generalization error) can be decomposed into two parts: an approximation part that is due to the finite number of parameters of the approximation scheme used; and an estimation part that is due to the finite number of data available.  We bound each of these two parts under certain assumptions and prove a general bound for a class of approximation schemes that include radial basis functions and multilayer perceptrons.
