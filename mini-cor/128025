Classification with Multiple Latent Variable Models using Maximum Entropy Discrimination
 Abstract In this paper we propose a method to use multiple generative models for classification tasks.  The standard approach to use generative models for classification is to train a separate model for each class.  A novel data point is then classified by the model that gives it the highest probability.  The algorithm we propose alters the parameters of the models to improve the classification accuracy.  The algorithm is based on the maximum entropy discrimination method, recently introduced by T.  Jaakkola.  Our approach is made computationally tractable by assuming that each of the models is deterministic, by which we mean that a data-point is associated to only a single latent or hidden state.  The resulting algorithm is an interesting variant of the support vector machine learning algorithm.  We show and compare test results on a handwritten digit recognition problem.
