Staged Mixture Modeling and Boosting
 In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a data-driven staged mixture modeling technique for building density, regression, and classi#cation models.  Our basic approach is to sequentially add components to a finite mixture model using the structural expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm.  We show that our technique is qualitatively similar to boosting.  This correspondence is a natural byproduct of the fact that we use the SEM algorithm to sequentially fit the mixture model.  Finally, in our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of prediction and density estimation tasks using real-world data.
