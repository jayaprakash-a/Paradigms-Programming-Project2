A nonparametric hierarchical bayesian framework for information filtering
 ABSTRACT Information filtering has made considerable progress in recent years.  The predominant approaches are content-based methods and collaborative methods.  Researchers have largely concentrated on either of the two approaches since a principled unifying framework is still lacking.  This paper suggests that both approaches can be combined under a hierarchical Bayesian framework.  Individual content-based user profiles are generated and collaboration between various user models is achieved via a common learned prior distribution.  However, it turns out that a parametric distribution (e. g.  Gaussian) is too restrictive to describe such a common learned prior distribution.  We thus introduce a nonparametric common prior, which is a sample generated from a Dirichlet process which assumes the role of a hyper prior.  We describe effective means to learn this nonparametric distribution, and apply it to learn users' information needs.  The resultant algorithm is simple and understandable, and offers a principled solution to combine content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.  Within our framework, we are now able to interpret various existing techniques from a unifying point of view.  Finally we demonstrate the empirical success of the proposed information filtering methods.
