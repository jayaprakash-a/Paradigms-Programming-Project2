OPTIMIZING SVMS FOR COMPLEX CALL CLASSIFICATION
 ABSTRACT Large margin classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Adaboost are obvious choices for natural language document or call routing.  However, how to combine several binary classifiers to optimize the whole routing process and how this process scales when it involves many different decisions (or classes) is a complex problem that has only received partial answers [1, 2].  We propose a global optimization process based on an optimal channel communication model that allows a combination of possibly heterogeneous binary classifiers.  As in Markov modeling, computational feasibility is achieved through simplifications and independence assumptions that are easy to interpret.  Using this approach, we have managed to decrease the call-type classification error rate for AT&T's How May I Help You (HMIHY( sm) ) natural dialog system by 50%.
