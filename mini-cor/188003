Gaussian Process Priors with Uncertain Inputs - Application to Multiple-Step Ahead Time Series Forecasting
 Abstract We consider the problem of multi-step ahead prediction in time series analysis using the non-parametric Gaussian process model.  k-step ahead forecasting of a discrete-time non-linear dynamic system can be performed by doing repeated one-step ahead predictions.  For a state-space model of the form y t = f(y
