An example-based approach to style translation for line drawings
 Abstract We present an example-based system for translating line drawings into different styles.  The system is given a training set of many different lines, each drawn by an artist in various styles, which is used to translate new lines made by a user into a particular desired style with a K-nearest neighbor algorithm.  This algorithm fits each input line as a linear combination of the several training lines in the same style which are most similar to it.  The fit line can then be rendered in different styles because the training set contains versions of each training line in eachstyle.  By describing input lines as linear combinations of training set lines, this procedure is expressive enough to fit a broad range of input drawings.  By restricting these linear combinations to contain only the most similar training set lines, this procedure is constrained enough to preserve the distinctive stylistic features of translated lines.  We represent input lines by splines with nonuniformly spaced control points, which emphasizes these stylistic features.  Our example-based approachhasanumber of advantages over conventional parameteric approaches to translating style.  It can handle styles which are difficult to describe parametrically, and its repertoire can be easily extended by the user at any time.  Moreover, given appropriate representations, it can be generalized to modify the style of other kinds of graphics objects, such as the font of a letter or the movementstyle of an animated character.
