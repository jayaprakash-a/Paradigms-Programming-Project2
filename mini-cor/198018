Estimating incumbency advantage and its variation, as an example of a before/after study
 Abstract Incumbency advantage is one of the most studied features in American legislative elections.  In this paper, we construct and implement an estimate that allows incumbency advantage to vary between individual incumbents.  This model predicts that open-seat elections will be less variable than those with incumbents running, an observed empirical pattern that is not explained by previous models.  We apply our method to the U. S.  House of Representatives in the twentieth century: our estimate of the overall pattern of incumbency advantage over time is similar to previous estimates (although slightly lower), and we also find a pattern of increasing variation.  More generally, our multilevel model represents a new method for estimating effects in before/after studies.
