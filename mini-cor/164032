Passwords you'll never forget, but can't recall
 ABSTRACT We identify a wide range of human memory phenomena as potential certificates of identity.  These "imprinting" behaviors are characterized by vast capacity for complex experiences, which can be recognized without apparent effort and yet cannot be transferred to others.  They are suitable for use in near zero-knowledge protocols, which minimize the amount of secret information exposed to prying eyes while identifying an individual.  We sketch several examples of such phenomena[1-3], and apply them in secure certification protocols.  This provides a novel approach to human-computer interfaces, and raises new questions in several classic areas of psychology.
