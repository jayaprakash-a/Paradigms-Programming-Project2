Selectivity and sparseness in the responses of striate complex cells
 Abstract Probability distributions of macaque complex cell responses to a large set of images were determined.  Measures of selectivity were based on the overall shape of the response probability distribution, as quantified by either kurtosis or entropy.  We call this non-parametric selectivity, in contrast to parametric selectivity, which measures tuning curve bandwidths.  To examine how receptive field properties a0ected
