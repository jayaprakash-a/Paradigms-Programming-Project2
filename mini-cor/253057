Rule-Based Anomaly Pattern Detection for Detecting Disease Outbreaks
 Abstract Searching for anomalies in multidimensional data with a temporal component is a dicult task especially when the exact features of the anomalies are unknown.  A standard but simplistic algorithm would be to obtain counts of certain events over a time interval such as a day and mark that interval to contain anomalies if this count exceeds a threshold.  This naive approach misses anomalies that aggregate in feature space but do not occur frequently enough to skew the count of monitored events over the time interval.  A desired solution should find these anomalous patterns rather than individual anomalies.  In order to approach this problem, we propose using a rule-based anomaly detection algorithm that characterizes each anomalous pattern with a rule.  The significance of each rule is carefully evaluated using Fisher's Exact Test and a randomization test.  The performance of our algorithm is compared against the standard algorithm by measuring the number of false positives and the timeliness of detection.  Simulated data is used in the evaluation phase.  This data was produced by a simulator that simulates the effects of a disease outbreak on a city.  The results indicate that our algorithm has significantly better detection times for common significance thresholds while having a slightly higher false positive rate.
