Circuits for bistable spike-timing-dependent plasticity neuromorphic VLSI synapses
 Abstract We present analog neuromorphic circuits for implementing bistable synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) properties.  In these types of synapses, the short-term dynamics of the synaptic efficacies are governed by the relative timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes, while on long time scales the efficacies tend asymptotically to either a potentiated state or to a depressed one.  Test results from a prototype VLSI chip, containing a learning synapse connected to a pre- and post-synaptic integrate and fire neuron, demonstrate the synapse's STDP learning properties, and its long-term bistable characteristics.
