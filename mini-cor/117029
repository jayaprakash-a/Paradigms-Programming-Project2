Mining of ad-hoc business processes with TeamLog
 The design of workflows is a complicated task.  In practice, the actual workflow processes will often differ from the processes as perceived by the management.  Process mining supports the design and improvement of processes using transaction logs, which contain information about the actual process executions.  This paper introduces basics about process mining, a common workflow log format and it gives an example: mining ad-hoc processes of Caramba--aprocess-aware collaboration system.  It is discussed how Caramba-specific process information is converted to a common format using an application called TeamLog.  Then EMiT--aprocess mining tool -- mines the converted process information.
