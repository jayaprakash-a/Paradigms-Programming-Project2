Global Min-cuts in RNC, and Other Ramifications of a Simple Min-Cut Algorithm
 Abstract This paper presents a new algorithm for finding global min-cuts in weighted, undirected graphs.  One of the strengths of the algorithm is its extreme simplicity.  This randomized algorithm can be implemented as a strongly polynomial sequential algorithm with running time ~ O(mn 2 ), even if space is restricted to O(n), or can be parallelized as an RNC algorithm which runs in time O(log 2 n) on a CRCW PRAM with mn 2 log n processors.  In addition to yielding the best known processor bounds on unweighted graphs, this algorithm provides the first proof that the min-cut problem for weighted undirected graphs is in RNC.  The algorithm does more than find a single min-cut; it finds all of them.  The algorithm also yields numerous results on network reliability, enumeration of cuts, multi-way cuts, and approximate min-cuts.
