Document Image Decoding Using Iterated Complete Path Search with Subsampled Heuristic Scoring
 Abstract It has been shown that the computation time of Document Image Decoding can be significantly reduced by employing heuristics in the search for the best decoding of a text line.  In the Iterated Complete Path (ICP)
