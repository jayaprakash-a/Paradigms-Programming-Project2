Training PDMs on Models: The Case of Deformable Superellipses
 Abstract This paper addresses the following problem: How can we make a complicated mathematical shape model simpler while keeping a comparable level of representational power? The proposed solution is to use the original model itself -- which represents a class of shapes -- to train a Point Distribution Model.  In this paper the idea is applied to the case of deformable superellipses.
