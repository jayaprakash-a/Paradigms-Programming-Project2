Model-based brightness constraints: on direct estimation of structure and motion
 Abstract We describe a new direct method for estimating structure and motion from image intensities of multiple views.  We extend the direct methods of [9] to three views.  Adding the third view enables us to solve for motion, and compute a dense depth map of the scene, directly from image spatiotemporal derivatives in a linear manner without first having to find point correspondences or compute optical flow.  We describe the advantages and limitations of this method which are then verified with experiments using real images.
