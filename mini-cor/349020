Learning to Align Sequences: A Maximum-Margin Approach
 Abstract We propose a discriminative method for learning the parameters (e. g.  cost of substitutions, deletions, insertions) of linear sequence alignment models from training examples.  While the resulting training problem leads to an optimization problem with an exponential number of constraints, we present a simple algorithm that finds an arbitrarily close approximation after considering only a subset of the constraints that is linear in the number of training examples and polynomial in the length of the sequences.  We also evaluate empirically that the method effectively learns good parameter values while being computationally feasible.
