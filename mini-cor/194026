On Combining Classifiers
 Abstract---We develop a common theoretical framework for combining classifiers which use distinct pattern representations and show that many existing schemes can be considered as special cases of compound classification where all the pattern representations are used jointly to make a decision.  An experimental comparison of various classifier combination schemes demonstrates that the combination rule developed under the most restrictive assumptions---the sum rule---outperforms other classifier combinations schemes.  A sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically.
