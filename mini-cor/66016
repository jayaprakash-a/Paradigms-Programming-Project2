On Feature Distributional Clustering for Text Categorization
 ABSTRACT We describe a new powerful text categorization method that is based on a combination of distributional features with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.  Our feature selection approach uses distributional clustering of words via the recently introduced information bottleneck method, which generates a more ecient representation of the documents.  When combined with the classification power of Support Vector Machines we produce the best known multilabel categorization results on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
