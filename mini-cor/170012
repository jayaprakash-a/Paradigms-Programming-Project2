Experiences with Extension Programming and Scripting in Python
 Abstract Our experiences interfacing Python with optimization software are presented.  The same work was done using extension programming and scripting.  Due to the nature of the C libraries we were using, we found problems related to memory corruption and C namespace collisions when we used the libraries as Python extensions.  For our application and the software we are interfacing to, we found that using the libraries as standalone programs connected via Python scripting was a better way to use the optimization codes via Python.
