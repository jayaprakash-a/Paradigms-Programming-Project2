Bihomogeneity of solenoids
 Abstract Solenoids are inverse limit spaces over regular covering maps of closed manifolds.  M. C.  McCord has shown that solenoids are topologically homogeneous and that they are principal bundles with a pro#nite structure group.  We show that if a solenoid is bihomogeneous, then its structure group contains an open abelian subgroup.  This leads to new examples of homogeneous continua that are not bihomogeneous.
