Is human object recognition better described by geon-structural-descriptions or by multiple-views?
 ABSTRACT Is human object recognition viewpoint dependent or viewpointinvariant under \everyday" conditions? Biederman and Gerhardstein (1993) argue that viewpoint-invariant mechanisms are used almost exclusively. However, our analysis indicates that: 1) their conditions for immediate viewpointinvariance lack the generalitytocharacterize a wide range of recognition phenomena; 2) the extensive body of viewpoint-dependent results cannot be dismissed as processing \by-products" or \experimental artifacts"; 3) geon structural descriptions cannot coherently account for category recognition, the domain they are intended to explain.  We conclude that the weight of current evidence supports an exemplar-based multiple-
