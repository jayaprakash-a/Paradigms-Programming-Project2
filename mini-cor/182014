Maximum Entropy Discrimination
 Abstract We present a general framework for discriminative estimation based on the maximum entropy principle and its extensions.  All calculations involve distributions over structures and/or parameters rather than specific settings and reduce to relative entropy projections.  This holds even when the data is not separable within the chosen parametric class, in the context of anomaly detection rather than classification, or when the labels in the training set are uncertain or incomplete.  Support vector machines are naturally subsumed under this class and we provide several extensions.  We are also able to estimate exactly and eciently discriminative distributions over tree structures of class-conditional models within this framework.  Preliminary experimental results are indicative of the potential in these techniques.
