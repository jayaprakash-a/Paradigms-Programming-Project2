Short-Term Memory in Visual Routines for "Off-Road Car Chasing"
 Abstract Using "off-road car chasing" as an example task, this paper explores the need for short-term memory (or ``internal state") in visual routines.  The driving domain involves dynamics, uncertainty and requires a tight sense-act loop.  Some previous demonstrations of visual routines avoided the need for short-term memory by providing their agent with a bird's-eye view or a 360 ffi view [ Agre and Chapman, 1987; Chapman, 1990; Reece, 1992 ] .  In contrast, our SGI-rendered simulation provides a realistic, robot-centered view of the environment in which limited field of view and occlusions necessitate memory of past perceptions and actions.  Our agent's action policy maintains a minimal, task-specific amounts of memory using a finite state machine.
