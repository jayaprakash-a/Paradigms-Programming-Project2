Specialization of Neural Mechanisms Underlying Face Recognition in Human Infants
 Abstract & Newborn infants respond preferentially to simple face-like patterns, raising the possibility that the face-specific regions identified in the adult cortex are functioning from birth.  We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by characterizing the specificity of infants' electrocortical responses to faces in two ways: (1) comparing responses to faces of humans with those to faces of nonhuman primates; and 2) comparing responses to upright and inverted faces.  Adults' face-responsive N170 event-related potential (ERP) component showed specificity to upright human faces that was not observable at any point in the ERPs of infants.  A putative "infant N170" did show sensitivity to the species of the face, but the orientation of the face did not influence processing until a later stage.  These findings suggest a process of gradual specialization of cortical face processing systems during postnatal development.  &
