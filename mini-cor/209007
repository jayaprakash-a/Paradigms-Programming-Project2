SHORT COMMUNICATION Semantic memory retrieval: cortical couplings in object recognition in the N400 window
 Abstract To characterize the regional changes in neuronal couplings and information transfer related to semantic aspects of object recognition in humans we used partial-directed EEG-coherence analysis (PDC).  We examined the differences of processing recognizable and unrecognizable pictures as reflected by changes in cortical networks within the time-window of a determined event-related potential (ERP) component, namely the N400.  Fourteen participants performed an image recognition task, while sequentially confronted with pictures of recognizable and unrecognizable objects.  The time-window of N400 as indicative of object semantics was defined from the ERP.  Differences of PDC in the beta-band between these tasks were represented topographically as patterns of electrical couplings, possibly indicating changing degrees of functional cooperation between brain areas.  Successful memory retrieval of picture meaning appears to be supported by networks comprising left temporal and parietal regions and bilateral frontal brain areas.
