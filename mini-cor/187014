Asymmetrical Filters for Vision Chips: a Basis for the Design of Large Sets of Spatial and Spatiotemporal Filters
 Abstract The problem of actual vision machines on VLSI is the implementation of a large set of linear filters selective to features such as edges, corners, orientations, motion.  This procedurerequires large arrays of filters with complex structures.  In order to reducethecomplexity, we propose to implement a simple basis of filters able to generate morecomplex filters such as oriented quadratureband-pass filters, quadraturewedge filters, velocity tuned filters.  The current basis consists of asymmetrical filters implemented with Cellular Neural Networks having only one layer and interactions with four neighbors.  We show that this basis generates relevant filters for vision applications and show how the particular structure of the filters basis allows the direct implementation of spatio-temporal filters with a low aditional cost.
