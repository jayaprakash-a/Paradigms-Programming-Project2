A bayesian approach to transcript estimation from gene array data: the BEAM technique
 ABSTRACT We present a new statistically optimal approach to estimate transcript levels and ratios from one or more gene array experiments.  The Bayesian Estimation of Array Measurements (BEAM) technique uses a model of measurement noise and prior information to estimate biological expression levels.  It provides a principled method to deal with negative expression level measurements, combine multiple measurements, and identify changes in expression level.  BEAM is more flexible than existing techniques, because it does not assume a specific functional form for noise and prior models.  Rather, it uses a more accurate noise model developed from experimental data, a process we illustrate here using Aymetrix yeast chips.
