Context-Free Recognition with Weighted Automata
 Abstract We introduce the definition of language recognition with weighted automata, a generalization of the classical definition of recognition with unweighted acceptors.  We show that, with our definition of recognition, weighted automata can be used to recognize a class of languages that strictly includes regular languages.  The class of languages accepted depends on the weight set which has the algebraic structure of a semiring.  We give a generic linear time algorithm for recognition with weighted automata and describe examples with various weight sets illustrating the recognition of several classes of context-free languages.  We prove, in particular, that the class of languages equivalent to the language of palindromes can be recognized by weighted automata over the (+; \Delta)-semiring, and that the class of languages equivalent to the Dyck language of first order D 0\Lambda 1 can be recognized by weighted automata over the real tropical semiring.
