A New Approach to the Minimum Cut Problem
 Abstract This paper presents a new approach to finding minimum cuts in undirected graphs.  The fundamental principle is simple: the edges in a graph's minimum cut form an extremely small fraction of the graph's edges.  Using this idea, we give a randomized, strongly polynomial algorithm that finds the minimum cut in an arbitrarily weighted undirected graph with high probability.  The algorithm runs in O(n 2 log 3 n) time, a significant improvement over the previous ~ O(mn) time bounds based on maximum flows.  It is simple and intuitive and uses no complex data structures.  Our algorithm can be parallelized to run in RNC with n 2 processors; this gives the first proof that the minimum cut problem can be solved in RNC.  The algorithm does more than find a single minimum cut; it finds all of them.  With minor modifications, our algorithm solves two other problems of interest.  Our algorithm finds all cuts with value within a multiplicative factor of ff of the minimum cut's in expected ~ O(n 2ff ) time, or in RNC with n 2ff processors.  The problem of finding a minimum multiway cut of a graph into r pieces is solved in expected ~ O(n 2(r\Gamma 1) ) time, or in RNC with n 2(r \Gamma 1) processors.  The "trace"
