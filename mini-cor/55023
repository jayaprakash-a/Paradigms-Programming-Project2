Support Vector Machine Active Learning with Application sto Text Classification
 Abstract Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks.  However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance.  In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning.  Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them.  We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i. e. , an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next.  We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space.  We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.
