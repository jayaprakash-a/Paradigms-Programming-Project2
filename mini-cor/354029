On Coding for Non-Multicast Networks
 Abstract We consider the issue of coding for non-multicast networks.  For multicast networks, it is known that linear operations over a field no larger than the number of receivers are sucient to achieve all feasible connections.  In the case of nonmulticast networks, necessary and sucient conditions are known, if we restrict ourselves to linear codes over a finite field [1].  However, no linearity suciency results exist for non-multicast networks.  Indeed, [2] shows that linearity over a field is not sucient in general.  We present a coding theorem that provides necessary and sucient conditions, in terms of receiver entropies, for an arbitrary set of connections to be achievable on any network.  We conjecture that linearity is sucient to satisfy the coding theorem, when linear operations are performed over vectors rather than scalars in a field.  We illustrate the intuition of this conjecture with an example.  This work is part of an ongoing cooperation with R.  Koetter.
