Distribution patterns of over-represented k-mers in non-coding yeast DNA
 Abstract Motivation: Over-represented k-mers in genomic DNA regions are often of particular biological interest.  For example, over-represented k-mers in co-regulated families of genes are associated with the DNA binding sites of transcription factors.  To measure over-representation, we introduce a statistical background model based on single-mismatches, and apply it to the pooled 500bp ORF upstream regions of yeast.  More importantly, we investigate the context and spatial distribution of overrepresented k-mers in yeast upstream regions.  Results: Single and double-stranded spatial distributions of most over-represented k-mers are highly nonrandom, and predominantly cluster into a small number of classes that are robust with respect to overrepresentation measures.  Specifically, we show that the threemostcommon distribution patterns can berelatedto DNA structure, function, and evolution and correspond to: a) homologous ORF clusters associated with sharply localized distributions; b) regulatory elements associated with a symmetric broad hill-shaped distribution in the 50-200 bp upstream region; and c) runs of As, Ts, and ATs associated with a broad hill-shaped distribution also in the 50-200 bp upstream region, with extreme structural properties.  Analysis of over-representation, homology, localization, and DNA structureare essential components of a general data-mining approach to finding biologically important k-mers in raw genomic DNA and understanding the "lexicon"ofregulatory regions.
