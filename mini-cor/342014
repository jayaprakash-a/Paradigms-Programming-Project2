Reaching for Dexterous Manipulation MIT EECS Area Exam
 Abstract I review three papers in the area of dexterous manipulation by machines.  These papers focus on different stages of the process of grasping an object.  The first describes a method for generating a suitable hand pose to grasp an object at a given set of contact points.  The second describes a method for adapting an example manipulation task from a given object to a new object.  The third describes a control-theoretic method for iteratively improving the quality of a given grasp of an object of unknown geometry and using only tactile sensory information.  These three papers are good examples of mainstream work in dexterous manipulation.  Following a brief review of the essential idea presented by each of these three papers, I consider the relationships between each of these approaches, focusing on the larger issues that loom in the differences between them.  Finally, I propose some new ideas to try to open the door to dexterous manipulation in more ordinary, unstructured human environments.
