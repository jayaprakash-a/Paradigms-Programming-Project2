Collective Multi-Label Text Classification
 Abstract Multi-label classification, the task of assigning one or more class labels to a document, arises in many domains.  In the multi-label domain the categories need not be independent.  As examples, a news article may be about multiple related topics and a medical journal article may pertain to multiple medical conditions.  A common approach to multi-label classification is to train independent binary classifiers for each label, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies between labels.  This paper explores conditional random field models for classifying documents that may have multiple labels.  Single-label CRF models maintain features for word occurrence patterns; the models that this paper describes additionally maintain features corresponding to label co-occurrence patterns.  These models outperform their independently trained singlelabel counterparts using several evaluation metrics on widely used corpora having varying characteristics.  For example, even for sparsely multi-labeled corpora the models reduce subset classification error by as much as 30%.  In addition, the models exhibit comparable F1-scores to the best performing classifiers under similar training conditions.
