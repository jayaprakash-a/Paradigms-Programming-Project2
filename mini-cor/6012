The Vocal Joystick: A Voice-Based Human-Computer Interface for Individuals with Motor Impairments
 Abstract We present a novel voice-based humancomputer interface designed to enable individuals with motor impairments to use vocal parameters for continuous control tasks.  Since discrete spoken commands are ill-suited to such tasks, our interface exploits a large set of continuous acousticphonetic parameters like pitch, loudness, vowel quality, etc.  Their selection is optimized with respect to automatic recognizability, communication bandwidth, learnability, suitability, and ease of use.  Parameters are extracted in real time, transformed via adaptation and acceleration, and converted into continuous control signals.  This paper describes the basic engine, prototype applications (in particular, voice-based web browsing and a controlled trajectory-following task), and initial user studies confirming the feasibility of this technology.
