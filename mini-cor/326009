Agnostic Learning of Geometric Patterns (Extended Abstract)
 Abstract Goldberg, Goldman, and Scott demonstrated how the problem of recognizing a landmark from a one-dimensional visual image can be mapped to that of learning a one-dimensional geometric pattern and gave a PAC algorithm to learn that class.  We present an on-line agnostic learning algorithm for learning the class of one-dimensional geometric patterns.  Since, when moving from the processed visual image to a one-dimensional pattern some key information is lost, we define a class of two-dimensional geometric patterns for which the important features from the visual image are incorporated in the geometric pattern, and show how to extend our agnostic learning algorithm to this class of two-dimensional patterns.  Next, we extend our construction to obtain an efficient agnostic learning algorithm (that tolerate classification and attribute noise) for the class of geometric patterns of arbitrary (constant) dimension d.  This mapping and learning algorithm is applicable to any data representable as a constant-dimensional array of values, e. g.  sonar data, temporal difference information, or amplitudes of a waveform.  To our knowledge, these classes of patterns are more complex than any class of geometric patterns previously studied.  Also our results are easily adapted to learn the union of fixed-dimensional boxes from multiple-instance
