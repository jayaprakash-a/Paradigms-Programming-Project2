Confidence measures for multimodal identity verification
 Abstract Multimodal fusion for identity verification has already shown great improvement compared to unimodal algorithms.  In this paper, we propose to integrate con#dence measures during the fusion process.  We present a comparison of three different methods to generate such confidence information from unimodal identity verification systems.  These methods can be used either to enhance the performance of a multimodal fusion algorithm or to obtain a confidence level on the decisions taken by the system.  All the algorithms are compared on the same benchmark database, namely XM2VTS, containing both speech and face information.  Results show that some confidence measures did improve statistically significantly the performance, while other measures produced reliable confidence levels over the fusion decisions.
