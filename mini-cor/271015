Learning to Create Customized Authority Lists
 Abstract The proliferation of hypertext and the popularity of Kleinberg's HITS algorithm have brought about an increased interest in link analysis.  While HITS and its older relatives from the Bibliometrics provide a method for finding authoritative sources on a particular topic, they do not allow individual users to inject their own opinions on what sources are authoritative.  This paper presents a technique for learning a user's internal model of authority.  We present experimental results based on Cora on-line index, a database of approximately one million on-line computer science literature references.
