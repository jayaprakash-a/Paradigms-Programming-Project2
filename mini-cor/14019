A Subthreshold-CMOS Chaotic Oscillator
 Abstract This paper reports on the design of a subthreshold-CMOS chaotic oscillator based on Chua's circuit.  The circuit is autonomous and generates chaotic signals from three state variables in a manner analogous to a Chua circuit.  Previous CMOS IC versions of the Chua
