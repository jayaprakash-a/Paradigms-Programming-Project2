Behavior Engineering with "Dual Dynamics" Models and Design Tools
 Abstract Dual Dynamics (DD) is a mathematical model of a behavior control system for mobile autonomous robots.  Behaviors are specified through dierential equations, forming a global dynamical system made of behavior subsystems which interact in a number of ways.  DD models can be directly compiled into executable code.  The article (i) explains the model, (ii) sketches the Dual Dynamics Designer (DDD) environment that we use for the design, simulation, implementation and documentation, and (iii) illustrates our approach with the example of kicking a moving ball into a goal.
