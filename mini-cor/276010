Playing the Matching-Shoulders Lob-Pass Game with Logarithmic Regret
 Abstract The best previous algorithm for the matching shoulders lob-pass game, arthur (Abe and Takeuchi 1993), suffered O(t 1=2 ) regret.  We prove that this is the best possible performance for any algorithm that works by accurately estimating the opponent's payoff lines.  Then we describe an algorithm which beats that bound and meets the information-theoretic lower bound of O(log t) regret by converging to the best lob rate without accurately estimating the payoff lines.  The noise-tolerant binary search procedure that we develop is of independent interest.  1 Background The lob-pass problem has its origins in the animal psychology literature (Herrnstein 1990), but following Abe and Takeuchi (1993) we consider it to be the following simplified tennis game.  For each of a sequence of plays we choose to make either a lob or a passing shot.  The opponent then stochastically hits or misses our shot, and in the latter case we score a point.  The opponent adapts in a way that devalues shots that have been selected frequently.  Specifically, the chance of scoring with a given shot is a linear function of the cumulative lob rate, which is the total number of lobs that we have made divided by the total number of shots that we have made.  Throughout this paper we represent the cumulative lob rate by the variable r.  The payoff functions of two sample opponents are shown in figure 1.  Clearly, the odds of scoring with a lob decreases as one moves to the right on the diagrams, and the odds of scoring with a pass decreases as one moves to the left.  We should emphasise that the x-axis here does not correspond to our instantaneous lob rate, but to the cumulative lob rate that is calculated by the opponent.  This means that
