EXACT TAIL BOUND OF BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTED VARIABLES
 Sets will be denoted by upper roman capital letters, e. g.  X , whilst elements are denoted by roman lower capital letters, e. g.  x.  We shall only be concerned with measure spaces (N; P (N)), i. e.  natural numbers and the collection of all power sets.  We denote a probability measure by PX , where the sans serif X will be called random variable 1 .  The expectation value is denoted by EX [g (X)] and is defined by EX [g (X)] = 1 X x=0 g (x) PX (x) : If X 1 ; : : : ; Xn are independent random variables, we define X = 1 n P n i=1 X i as the mean of the random variables.  Then, the Law of Large numbers tells us that for any probability measure PX we have 8# } 0 lim n!1 PX n EX [X] X } # # = 0 : The binomial distribution B n;p with parameters n 2 N and 0 # p # 1 is defined by 80 # k 2 N # n B n;p (k) = # n k # p k (1 p) n k : Suppose we are given a binomial distributed variable X with known success probability p.  Then, we call T p (k) = P (X } k) the tail of the distribution of X.  If we have no knowledge of p we define the tail bound T to be T = max p fT p g : If X is distributed according to B 1;p we call X a Bernoulli variable.  2.  Tail bounds The value of tail bounds for binomial distributed variables becomes obvious if we consider that for n iid Bernoulli variables Y i we have X = P n i=1 Y i = nY binomial B n;p distributed and PY n p Y } # # = PX (np X } n#) = PX (X < np n#) = 1 T p (dnp n# 1e) # 1 T (dnp n# 1e) : 1 Such a distribution is sometimes called arithmetic with span 1 (see [3, p. 138]).  1 2 RALF HERBRICH,
