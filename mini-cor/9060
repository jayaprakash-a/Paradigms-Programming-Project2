DOCUMENT SPACE MODELS USING LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
 ABSTRACT In this paper, an approach for constructing mixture language models (LMs) based on some notion of semantics is discussed.  To this end, a technique known as latent semantic analysis (LSA) is used.  The approach encapsulates corpus-derived semantic information and is able to model the varying style of the text.  Using such information, the corpus texts are clustered in an unsupervised manner and mixture LMs are automatically created.  This work builds on previous work in the field of information retrieval which was recently applied by Bellegarda et.  al.  to the problem of clustering words by semantic categories.  The principal contribution of this work is to characterize the document space resulting from the LSA modeling and to demonstrate the approach for mixture LM application.  Comparison is made between manual and automatic clustering in order to elucidate how the semantic information is expressed in the space.  It is shown that, using semantic information, mixture LMs performs better than a conventional single LM with slight increase of computational cost.
