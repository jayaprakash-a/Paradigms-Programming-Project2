Using a Financial Training Criterion Rather than a Prediction Criterion
 Abstract The application of this work is to decision taking with financial time-series, using learning algorithms.  The traditional approach is to train a model using a prediction criterion, such as minimizing the squared error between predictions and actual values of a dependent variable, or maximizing the likelihood of a conditional model of the dependent variable.  We find here with noisy time-series that better results can be obtained when the model is directly trained in order to optimize the financial criterion of interest.  Experiments were performed on portfolio selection with 35 Canadian stocks.
