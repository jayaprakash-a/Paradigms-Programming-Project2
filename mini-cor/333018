HIERARCHICAL PARTITION OF THE ARTICULATORY STATE SPACE FOR OVERLAPPING-FEATURE BASED SPEECH RECOGNITION
 ABSTRACT We describe our recent work on improving an overlapping articulatory feature (sub-phonemic) based speech recognizer with robustness to the requirement of training data.  A new decision-tree algorithm is developed and applied to the recognizer design which results in hierarchical partitioning of the articulatory state space.  The articulatory states associated with common acoustic correlates, a phenomenon caused by the many-to-one articulation-to-acoustics mapping well known in speech production, are automatically clustered by the decision-tree algorithm.  This enables effective prediction of the unseen articulatory states in the training, thereby increasing the recognizer's robustness.  Some preliminary experimental results are provided.
