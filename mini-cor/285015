Learning over Sets using Kernel Principal Angles
 Abstract We consider the problem of learning with instances defined over a space of sets of vectors.  We derive a new positive definite kernel f (A,B) defined over pairs of matrices A,B based on the concept of principal angles between two linear subspaces.  We show that the principal angles can be recovered using only inner-products between pairs of column vectors of the input matrices thereby allowing the original column vectors of A,B to be mapped onto arbitrarily high-dimensional feature spaces.  We demonstrate the usage of the matrix-based kernel function f (A,
