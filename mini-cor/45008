The Memory Capacity of Subsampled Quadratic Classifiers: Why Active Dendrites May Remember More
 Abstract Previous biophysical modeling studies have suggested that neurons with active dendritic trees may be viewed as linear classifiers augmented by a few second-order product terms which arise from multiplicative interactions among synaptic inputs (Mel, 1992
