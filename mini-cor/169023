An Approach to Data Reduction and Clustering with Theoretical Guarantees
 Abstract We discuss the problem of representing a dataset of n points by a smaller number of representative points.  We introduce a novel objective function over the data set that yields a global minimum solution by ecient means.  This leads to a new approach to data reduction or unsupervised learning.  We derive an exact expression for the minimum training error and bounds on the generalization error of the scheme.  This shows how to precisely characterize overfitting in terms of an approximation-estimation tradeoff for unsupervised learning in this particular context.  As a result we are able to choose the optimal number of clusters.
