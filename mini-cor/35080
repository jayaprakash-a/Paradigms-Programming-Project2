A Desktop Input Device and Interface for Interactive 3D Character Animation
 Abstract We present a novel input device and interface for interactively controlling the animation of graphical human character from a desktop environment.  The trackers are embedded in a new physical design, which is both simple yet also provides significant benefits, and establishes a tangible interface with coordinate frames inherent to the character.  A layered kinematic motion recording strategy accesses subsets of the total degrees of freedom of the character.  We present the experiences of three novice users with the system, and that of a long-term user who has prior experience with other complex continuous interfaces.
