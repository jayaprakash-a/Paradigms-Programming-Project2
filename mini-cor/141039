 Abstract.  1-factorability of the composition of graphs is studied.  The followings sucient conditions are proved: G[H] is 1-factorable if G and H are regular and at least one of the following holds: (i) Graphs G and H both contain a 1-factor, (ii) G is 1-factorable (iii) H is 1-factorable.  It is also shown that the tensor product G # H is 1-factorable, if at least one of two graphs is 1-factorable.  This result in turn implies that the strong tensor product G# 0 H is 1-factorable, if G is 1-factorable.
