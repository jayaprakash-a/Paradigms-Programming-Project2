 Abstract Deep inelastic electron-photon scattering is studied using e + e\Gamma data collected by the OPAL detector at centre-of-mass energies p s ee M Z 0 .  The photon structure function F fl 2 (x; Q 2 ) is explored in a Q 2 range of 1. 1 to 6. 6 GeV 2 at lower x values than ever before.  To probe this kinematic region events are selected with a beam electron scattered into one of the OPAL luminosity calorimeters at scattering angles between 27 and 55 mrad.  A measurement is presented of the photon structure function F fl 2 (x; Q 2 ) at
