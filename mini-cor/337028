The Perceptron Algorithm with Uneven Margins
 Abstract The perceptron algorithm with margins is a simple, fast and effective learning algorithm for linear classifiers; it produces decision hyperplanes within some constant ratio of the maximal margin.  In this paper we study this algorithm and a new variant: the perceptron algorithm with uneven margins, tailored for document categorisation problems (i. e.  problems where classes are highly unbalanced and performance depends on the ranking of patterns).  We discuss the interest of these algorithms from a theoretical point of view, provide a generalisation of Noviko#'s theorem for uneven margins, give a geometrically description of these algorithms and show experimentally that both algorithms yield equal or better performances than support vector machines, while reducing training time and sparsity, in classification (USPS) and document categorisation (Reuters) problems.
