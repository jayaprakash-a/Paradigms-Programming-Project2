Bayesian Computation for Parametric Models of Heteroscedasticity in the Linear Model
 ABSTRACT In the linear model with unknown variances, one can often model the heteroscedasticity as var(y i ) = oe 2 f(w i ; `); where f is a fixed function, w i are the "weights" for the problem and ` is an unknown parameter (f(w i ; `) = w\Gamma ` i is a traditional choice).  We show how to do a fully Bayesian computation in this simple linear setting and also for a hierarchical model.  The full Bayesian computation has the advantage that we are able to average over our uncertainty in ` instead of using a point estimate.  We carry out the computations for a problem involving forecasting U. S.  Presidential elections, looking at different choices for f and the effects on both estimation and prediction.
