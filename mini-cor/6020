FACTORED SPARSE INVERSE COVARIANCE MATRICES
 ABSTRACT Most HMM-based speech recognition systems use Gaussian mixtures as observation probability density functions.  An important goal in all such systems is to improve parsimony.  One method is to adjust the type of covariance matrices used.  In this work, factored sparse inverse covariance matrices are introduced.  Based on U 0 DU factorization, the inverse covariance matrix can be represented using linear regressive coefficients which 1) correspond to sparse patterns in the inverse covariance matrix (and therefore represent conditional independence properties of the Gaussian), and 2), result in a method of partial tying of the covariance matrices without requiring non-linear EM update equations.  Results show that the performance of full-covariance Gaussians can be matched by factored sparse inverse covariance Gaussians having significantly fewer parameters.
