Trade-offs between communication throughput and parallel time
 Abstract We study the effect of limited communication throughput on parallel computation in a setting where the number of processors is much smaller than the length of the input.  Our model has p processors that communicate through a shared memory of size m.  The input has size n, and can be read directly by all the processors.  We will be primarily interested in studying cases where n AE p AE m.  As a test case we study the list reversal problem.  For this problem we prove a time lower bound of \Omega( n p mp ).  (A similar lower bound holds also for the problems of sorting, finding all unique elements, convolution, and universal hashing. ) This result shows that limiting the communication (i. e. , small m) has significant effect on parallel computation.  We show an almost matching upper bound of O( n p mp log O(1) n).  The upper bound requires the development of a few interesting techniques which can alleviate the limited communication in some general settings.  Specifically,
