CENTER FOR MACHINE PERCEPTION CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY REPRINT A New Class of Learnable Detectors for Categorisation
 Abstract.  A new class of image-level detectors that can be adapted by machine learning techniques to detect parts of objects from a given category is proposed.  A classifier (e. g.  neural network or adaboost trained classifier) within the detector selects a relevant subset of extremal regions, i. e.  regions that are connected components of a thresholded image.  Properties of extremal regions render the detector very robust to illumination change.  Robustness to viewpoint change is achieved by using invariant descriptors and/or by modeling shape variations by the classifier.  The approach is brought to bear on three problems: text detection, face segmentation and leopard skin detection.  High detection rates were obtained for unconstrained (i. e.  brightness, affine and font invariant) text detection (92%) with a reasonable false positive rate.  The time-complexity of the detection is approximately linear in the number of pixels and a non-optimized implementation runs at about 1 frame per second for a 640 480 image on a high-end PC.
