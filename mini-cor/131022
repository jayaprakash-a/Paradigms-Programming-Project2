Site Model Acquisition and Extension from Aerial Images
 Abstract A system has been developed to acquire, extend and refine 3D geometric site models from aerial imagery.  This system hypothesize potential building roofs in an image, automatically locates supporting geometric evidence in other images, and determines the precise shape and position of the new buildings via multiimage triangulation.  Model-to-image registration techniques are applied to align new, incoming images against the site model.  Model extension and refinement procedures are then performed to add previously unseen buildings and to improve the geometric accuracy of the existing 3D building models.
