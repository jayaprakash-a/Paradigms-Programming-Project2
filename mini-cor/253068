Eigengalaxies for Fast Galaxy Morphology
 Abstract We investigate the following nonlinear regression problem from astronomy: given a noisy, distorted image of an unknown galaxy, find the best-#tting parameters for a galaxy-image model quickly .  Solving this problem is of importance to the field of astronomy, since the distribution of galactic morphologies tests cosmological theories which are under-constrained.  This is an area of active research and there are tens of millions of images which have not been analyzed due to computational costs.  The algorithm follows the nonparametric paradigm by populating image space with several million model galaxies ahead of time.  During run-time, it just finds the model image nearest to the unknown image and returns that as the answer.  Using "eigengalaxies" allows the algorithm to achieve significant improvements in speed over previously published techniques.
