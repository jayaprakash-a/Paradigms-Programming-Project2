Estimating the Probability of Events That have Never Occurred: When is Your Vote Decisive? \Lambda
 Abstract Researchers sometimes argue that statisticians have little to contribute when few realizations of the process being estimated are observed.  We show that this argument is incorrect even in the extreme situation of estimating the probabilities of events so rare that they have never occurred.  We show how statistical forecasting models allow us to use empirical data to improve inferences about the probabilities of these events.  Our application is estimating the probability that your vote will be decisive in a U. S.  presidential election, a problem that has been studied by political scientists for more than two decades.  The exact value of this probability is of only minor interest, but the number has important implications for understanding the optimal allocation of campaign resources, whether states and voter groups receive their fair share of attention from prospective presidents, and how formal "rational choice" models of voter behavior might be able to explain why people vote at all.
