 Abstract This paper presents modifications to a standard probabilistic context-free grammar that enable a predictive parser to avoid garden pathing without resorting to any ad-hoc heuristic repair.  The resulting parser is shown to apply eciently to both newspaper text and telephone conversations with complete coverage and excellent accuracy.  The distribution over trees is peaked enough to allow the parser to find parses eciently,even with the much larger search space.  Empirical results are provided for both Wall St.  Journal and Switchboard test corpora.
