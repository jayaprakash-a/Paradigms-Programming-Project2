A Similarity-Based Method for the Generalization of Face Recognition over Pose and Expression
 Abstract Human observers are capable of recognizing a face seen only once before when confronted with it subsequently under different viewing conditions.  We constructed a working computational model of such generalization from a single view, and tested it on a homogeneous database of face images obtained under tightly controlled viewing conditions.  The model effectively constructs a view space for novel faces by interpolating view spaces of familiar ones [5].  Its performance -- 30% error rate in one out of 18 recognition, and 8% in one out of three discrimination -- is encouraging, given that it reflects generalization from a single view/expression to a range of \Sigma34 ffi rotation in depth and to two additional expressions.  For comparison, human subjects in the one out of three task involving only viewpoint changes exhibit a 3% error rate [11].
