Defaults and Relevance in Model Based Reasoning \Lambda
 Abstract Reasoning with model-based representations is an intuitive paradigm, which has been shown to be theoretically sound and to possess some computational advantages over reasoning with formula-based representations of knowledge.  In this paper we present more evidence to the value of such representations.  Our results hinge on the notion of relevance, and model based representations are shown to be useful in capturing relevant information, and in allowing to ignore irrelevant information.  In particular, we consider situations where context-specific information is used in the process of reasoning.  We show that reasoning with model-
