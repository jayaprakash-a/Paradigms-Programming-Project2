Improved combination of online algorithms for acceptance and rejection
 ABSTRACT Given two admission control algorithms that are cA-acceptcompetitive and cR-reject-competitive respectively, we give two ways to make an algorithm that is simultaneously O(cA )accept-competitive and O(cAcR)-reject-competitive.  The combined algorithms make no reference to the offline optimal solution.  In addition, one of the algorithms does not require knowing the value of either cA or cR .  This improves on work of Azar, Blum, and Mansour, whose combined algorithm was O(c 2 A )-accept-competitive, involved computing offline optimal solutions, and required knowing the values of both cA and cR .
