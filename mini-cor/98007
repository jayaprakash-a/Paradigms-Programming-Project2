Comparison between networks of conductanceand current-driven neurons: stationary spike rates and subthreshold depolarization
 Abstract The problem of an equivalence between conductance- and current-driven neurons in terms of mean stationary output rates is investigated.  We show that it is possible to study a network of conductance-driven neurons by means of a mean 0eld analysis of an equivalent networkof current-driven neurons.  The current drive is Gauss distributed and not voltage dependent.  The equivalent networkis composed by the same neurons and exhibits the same stable 0ring rates at the only price of having di2erent connectivity.  In addition, the di2erences in the subthreshold depolarization and the interspike-interval distribution can be studied at parity of output rates, providing a method to study those e2ects of the conductance drive which do not arise in a networkof current-driven neurons.
