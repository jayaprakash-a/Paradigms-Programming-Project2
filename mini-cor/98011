An Algorithm for Modifying Neurotransmitter Release Probability Based on Pre- and Postsynaptic Spike Timing
 Abstract.  The precise times of occurrence of individual pre- and post-synaptic action potentials is known to play a key role in the modification of the synaptic ecacy.  Based on stimulation protocols of two synaptically connected neurons, we infer an algorithm which reproduces the experimental data by modifying the probability of vesicle discharge as a function of the relative timing of spikes in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons.  The primary feature of this algorithm is an asymmetry with respect to the direction of synaptic modification depending on whether the presynaptic spikes precede or follow the postsynaptic spike.  Specifically, if the presynaptic spike occurs up to 50ms before the postsynaptic spike, the probability of vesicle discharge is up-regulated while the probability of vesicle discharge is down-regulated if the presynaptic spike occurs up to 50ms after the postsynaptic spike.  In the case where neurons fire irregularly with Poisson spike trains at constant mean firing rates, the probability of vesicle discharge converges towards a characteristic value which is determined by the pre- and post-synaptic firing rates.  On the other hand, if the mean rates of the Poisson spike trains slowly change with time our algorithm predicts modifications in the probability of release which generalize Hebbian and BCM rules.  We conclude that the proposed spike-based synaptic learning algorithm provides a general framework for regulating neurotransmitter release probability.
