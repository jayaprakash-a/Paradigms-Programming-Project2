Direct Estimation of Non-Rigid Registrations
 Abstract Registering images of a deforming surface is a well-studied problem.  Solutions include computing optic flow or estimating a parameterized motion model.  In the case of optic flow it is necessary to include some regularization.  We propose an approach based on representing the induced transformation between images using Radial Basis Functions (RBF).  The approach can be viewed as a direct, i. e.  intensity-based, method, or equivalently, as a way of using RBFs as non-linear regularizers on the optic flow field.  The approach is demonstrated on several image sequences of deforming surfaces.  It is shown that the computed registrations are sufficiently accurate to allow convincing augmentations of the images.
