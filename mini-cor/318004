High Quality Document Image Compression with DjVu
 Abstract We present a new image compression technique called "DjVu " that is specifically geared towards the compression of high-resolution, high-quality images of scanned documents in color.  This enables fast transmission of document images over low-speed connections, while faithfully reproducing the visual aspect of the document, including color, fonts, pictures, and paper texture.  The DjVu compressor separates the text and drawings, which needs a high spatial resolution, from the pictures and backgrounds, which are smoother and can be coded at a lower spatial resolution.  Then, several novel techniques are used to maximize the compression ratio: the bi-level foreground image is encoded with AT&T's proposal to the new JBIG2 fax standard, and a new wavelet-based compression method is used for the backgrounds and pictures.  Both techniques use a new adaptive binary arithmetic coder called the Z-coder.  A typical magazine page in color at 300dpi can be compressed down to between40to60KB,approximately 5 to 10 times better than JPEG for a similar level of subjective quality.  A real-time, memory efficientversion of the decoder was implemented, and is available as a plug-in for popular web browsers.
