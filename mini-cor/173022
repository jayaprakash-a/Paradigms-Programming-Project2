1-norm Support Vector Machines
 Abstract The standard 2-norm SVM is known for its good performance in twoclass classication.  In this paper, we consider the 1-norm SVM.  We argue that the 1-norm SVM may have some advantage over the standard 2-norm SVM, especially when there are redundant noise features.  We also propose an efcient algorithm that computes the whole solution path of the 1-norm SVM, hence facilitates adaptive selection of the tuning parameter for the 1-norm SVM.
