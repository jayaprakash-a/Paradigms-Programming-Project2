THE THISL SYSTEM FOR INDEXING AND RETRIEVAL OF BROADCAST NEWS
 Abstract - This paper describes the THISL news retrieval system which maintains an archive of BBC radio and television news recordings.  The system uses the Abbot large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system to transcribe news broadcasts, and the thislIR text retrieval system to index and access the transcripts.  Decoding and indexing is performed automatically, and the archive is updated with three hours of new material every day.  A web-based interface to the retrieval system has been devised to facilitate access to the archive.
