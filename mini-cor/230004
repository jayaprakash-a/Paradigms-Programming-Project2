Marginalized Kernels Between Labeled Graphs
 Abstract A new kernel function between two labeled graphs is presented.  Feature vectors are defined as the counts of label paths produced by random walks on graphs.  The kernel computation finally boils down to obtaining the stationary state of a discrete-time linear system, thus is eciently performed by solving simultaneous linear equations.  Our kernel is based on an infinite dimensional feature space, so it is fundamentally dierent from other string or tree kernels based on dynamic programming.  We will present promising empirical results in classification of chemical compounds.  1
