Optimal spatial filtering of single trial EEG during imagined hand movement
 Abstract The development of an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) requires rapid and reliable discrimination of EEG patterns, e.  g. , associated with motor imagery.  One sided hand movement imagination results in EEG changes located at contra- and ipsilateral central areas.  We demonstrate that spatial filters for multi-channel EEG effectively extract discriminatory information from two populations of single-trial EEG, recorded during left and right hand movement imagery.  The best classification results for three subjects are 90. 8%, 92. 7%, and 99. 7%.  The spatial filters are estimated from a set of data by the method of Common Spatial Patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas.  The method performs a weighting of the electrodes according to their importance for the classification task.  The high recognition rates and computational simplicity make it a promising method for an EEG-based brain-computer interface.
