The THISL Spoken Document Retrieval Project
 ABSTRACT THISL is an ESPRIT Long Term Research Project focused the development and construction of a system to items from an archive of television and radio news broadcasts.  In this paper we outline our spoken document retrieval system based on the ABBOT speech recognizer and a text retrieval system based on Okapi term-weighting .  The system has been evaluated as part of the TREC-6 and TREC-7 spoken document retrieval evaluations and we report on the results of the TREC-7 evaluation based on a document collection of 100 hours of North American broadcast news.
