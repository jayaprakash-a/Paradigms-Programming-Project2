R-Cubed (R 3 ): Rate, Robustness, and Recovery An Availability Benchmark Framework
 Abstract: Benchmarks have historically guided research and development in computer systems performance.  As availability becomes an increasingly important metric for evaluating computer systems, there is a natural demand for availability benchmarks.  However, industry-wide availability benchmarks do not exist today.  This paper proposes a framework for benchmarking the availability of computer systems.  Our goal in this effort is to define a framework which can be used to implement availability benchmarks that are applicable across a wide range of systems.  The proposed framework is a hierarchical approach which goes beyond direct benchmarking of availability in terms of number of outage minutes per year.  This paper identifies the three key attributes impacting system availability (fault and maintenance rate, robustness, and recovery), and methods to benchmark these key attributes of availability.
