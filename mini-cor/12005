3D MODELING AND REGISTRATION UNDER WIDE BASELINE CONDITIONS
 ABSTRACT During the 90s important progess has been made in the area of structure-from-motion.  From a series of closely spaced images a 3D model of the observed scene can now be reconstructed, without knowledge about the subsequent camera positions or settings.  From nothing but a video, the camera trajectory and scene shape are extracted.  Progress has also been important in the area of structured light techniques.  Rather than having to use slow and/or bulky laser scanners, compact one-shot systems have been developed.  Upon projection of a pattern onto the scene, its 3D shape and texture can be extracted from a single image.  This paper presents recent extensions on both strands, that have a common theme: how to cope with large baseline conditions.  In the case of shape-from-video we discuss ways to find correspondences and, hence, extract 3D shapes even when the images are taken far apart.  In the case of structured light, the problem solved is how to combine partial 3D patches into complete models, without a good initialisation of their relative poses.
