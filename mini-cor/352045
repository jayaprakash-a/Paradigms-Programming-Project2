Age of Acquisition in Connectionist Networks
 Abstract Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of the Age of Acquisition (AoA) of an item in determining subjects' reaction time in naming words, objects, and faces.  Using the number of epochs required to learn an item as a direct measure of AoA in connectionist networks, Smith, Cottrell & Anderson (in press) have shown that AoA is a stronger predictor of final Sum Squared Error than frequency.  In this paper, we replicate Smith et al.
