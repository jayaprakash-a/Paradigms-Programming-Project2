Submitted to ACM Autonomous Agents 99 A Synthetic Agent System for Bayesian Modeling Human Interactions
 Abstract When building statistical machine learning models from real data one of the most frequently encountered difficulties is the limited amount of training data compared to what is needed by the specific learning architecture.  In order to deal with this problem we have developed a synthetic (simulated) agent training system that let us develop flexible prior models for recognizing human interactions in a pedestrian visual surveillance task.  We demonstrate the ability to use these prior models to accurately classify real human behaviors and interactions with no additional tuning or training.
