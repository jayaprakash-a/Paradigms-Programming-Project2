Bridging the Gap: Integrating Cellular and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies of the Hippocampus
 studies.  Despite these methodological and species-related differences, the neurophysiological studies offer insight into many of the questions raised by recent neuroimaging studies.  For instance, there is physiological evidence that suggests that the hippocampal memory system is functionally heterogeneous, which may explain some of the discrepancies in the location and extent of activation reported by different imaging studies of the medial temporal lobe.  In addition, we describe recent computational models of the hippocampus which may be useful for bridging the gap between neurophysiological and neuroimaging data.  Hippocampus 1999;
