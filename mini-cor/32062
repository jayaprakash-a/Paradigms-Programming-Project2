A NEW ALGORITHM FOR THE EVALUATION OF PTV DATA USING POINT MATCHING DISTANCE MEASURES AND DETERMINISTIC ANNEALING
 ABSTRACT We describe a new method for the evaluation of single pulse multiple exposure PTV data which allows the joint estimate of several local flow field parameters, among them components describing local translation, rotation and shear.  The method operates on particle coordinates, which can be extracted from digital images using the CLEAN algorithm by Schwarz (1978), and is based on an algorithm recently proposed by Gold et al.  (1996) for matching problems in stereo vision and statistical pattern recognition.  For flows with small velocity gradients our method compares favorable to cross-correlation techniques.  When velocity gradients become larger, for example near vortices and in shear flows, the new method leads to strongly improved velocity estimates, and additionally allows an estimate of the strength of the local rotation and shear components.  The method can in principle be extended to stereo data, because computational expenses grow linearly with the number of particle coordinates only.
