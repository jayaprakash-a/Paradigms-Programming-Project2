AUDIO TEXTURES
 ABSTRACT In this paper, we introduce a new audio medium, called audio texture, as a means of synthesizing long audio stream according to a given short example audio clip.  The example clip is analyzed, and basic building patterns are extracted.  Then an audio stream of arbitrary length is synthesized using a sequence of extracted building patterns.  The patterns can be varied in the synthesis process to add variations to the generated sound.  Audio textures are useful in applications such as background music, lullabies, game music, and screen saver sounds.  A method is proposed for implementing audio textures.  Preliminary results of audio textures are provided at our website for evaluation.
