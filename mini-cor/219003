Investigation of short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations using the reaction
 Abstract Two-proton correlations were studied in close to 4geometry using the reaction 12 C(e; e 0 pp).  The beam energy was 705 MeV, the energy transfer 225MeV, and the three-momentum transfer 412 MeV/c.  The electrons were observed in a largeacceptance magnetic spectrometer in coincidence with protons observed in a BGO crystal ball.  Missing energy and momentum, relative momentum and angular distributions were derived and compared with a factorized two-nucleon emission model.  Soft-core correlation functions are favoured by the data.
