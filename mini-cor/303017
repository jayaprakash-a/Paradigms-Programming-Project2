On the Toric Algebra of Graphical Models
 February 2002 Technical Report MSR-TR-2002-47 We formulate necessary and sucient conditions for an arbitrary discrete probability distribution to factor according to an undirected graphical model, or a log-linear model, or other more general exponential models.  This characterization generalizes the well-known Hammersley-Cli#ord Theorem.  We show that for decomposable graphical models these conditions are equivalent to a set of statistical independence facts as in the Hammersley-Cli#ord Theorem but that for non-decomposable graphical models they are not.  We also show that non-decomposable models can have non-rational maximum likelihood estimates.  Finally, using these results, we provide a characterization of decomposable graphical models.
