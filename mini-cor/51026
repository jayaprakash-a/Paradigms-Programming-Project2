An observation-constrained generative approach for probabilistic classification of image regions
 Abstract In this paper, we propose a probabilistic region classification scheme for natural scene images.  In conventional generative methods, a generative model is learnt for each class using all the available training data belonging to that class.  However, if an input image has been generated from only a subset of the model support, use of the full model to assign generative probabilities can produce serious artifacts in the probability assignments.  This problem arises mainly when the different classes have multimodal distributions with considerable overlap in the feature space.  We propose an approach to constrain the class generative probability of a set of newly observed data by exploiting the distribution of the new data itself and using linear weighted mixing.  A Kullback -- Leibler Divergence-based fast model selection procedure is also proposed for learning mixture models in a low dimensional feature space.  The preliminary results on the natural scene images support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
