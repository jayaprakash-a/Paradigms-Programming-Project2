JOINT CHANNEL TRACKING AND SYMBOL DETECTION IN MIMO SYSTEMS VIA MULTIPLE MODEL METHODS
 ABSTRACT We propose a new semi-blind joint channel tracking and symbol detection for spatial multiplexing MIMO system.  The proposed algorithm is based on Generalized Pesudo Bayesian algorithm (GPB) and Probability Data Association (PDA).  The purpose of GPB algorithm is to control the size of the filtering tree and Gaussian approximation idea behind PDA is applied to each time instant to reduce the model size.  Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.
