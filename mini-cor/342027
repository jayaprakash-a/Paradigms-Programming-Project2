Nodding in conversations with a robot
 ABSTRACT In this demo we describe our ongoing efforts to build a robot that can collaborate with a person in hosting activities.  We illustrate our current robot's conversations, which include gestures of various types, and report on extensions to the robot's existing gestural abilities to be able to recognize nodding in conversations.
