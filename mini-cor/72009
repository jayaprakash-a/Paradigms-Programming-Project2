Regularized spectral learning UW-Stat Dept TR # 465
 Abstract Spectral clustering is a technique for finding groups in data consisting of similarities S ij between pairs of points.  We approach the problem of learning the similarity as a function of other observed features, in order to optimize spectral clustering results on future data.  This paper formulates a new objective for learning in spectral clustering, that balances a clustering accuracy term, the gap, and a stability term, the eigengap with the later in the role of a regularizer.  We derive an algorithm to optimize this objective, and semiautomatic methods to chose the optimal regularization.  Preliminary experiments confirm the validity of the approach.
