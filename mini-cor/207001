Transformation Systems at NASA Ames
 ABSTRACT In this paper, we describe the experiences of the Automated Software Engineering Group at the NASA Ames Research Center in the development and application of three different transformation systems.  The systems span the entire technology range, from deductive synthesis, to logic-based transformation, to almost compiler-like source-to-source transformation.  These systems also span a range of NASA applications, including solving solar system geometry problems, generating data analysis software, and analyzing multithreaded Java code.
