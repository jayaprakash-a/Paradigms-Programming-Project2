Silicon Auditory Processors as Computer Peripherals
 Abstract Several research groups are implementing analog integrated circuit models of biological auditory processing.  The outputs of these circuit models have taken several forms, including video format for monitor display [1,2], simple scanned output for oscilloscope display [3], and parallel analog outputs suitable for data-acquisition systems [4].  In this paper, we describe an alternative output method for silicon auditory models, suitable for direct interface to digital computers.  As a prototype of this method, we describe an integrated circuit model of temporal adaptation in the auditory nerve, that functions as a peripheral to a workstation running the Unix operating system.  We show data from a working hybrid system that includes the auditory model, a digital interface, and asynchronous software; this system produces a real-time X-Windows display of the response of the auditory nerve model.
