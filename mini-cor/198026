Convergence Assessment of Monte Carlo Simulations via the Score Statistic
 Abstract In this paper, we present several applications of the score statistic in the context of convergence assessment for Monte Carlo simulations.  We begin by observing that the expected value of the score statistic is zero so that we may monitor the sample mean of this statistic throughout a simulation as a means to determine whether or not the simulation has been run for a suciently long time.  We also demonstrate a second assessment method based upon the idea of path sampling.  We demonstrate how the score statistic can be used to accurately estimate the stationary density using only a small number of simulated values and highlight the value of this technique for parametric density estimation.  In particular, these methods provide a powerful suite of tools which can be generically applied when alternatives such as the Rao-Blackwell density estimator is not available.  In this paper we focus upon the use of these density estimates for convergence assessment.  By running several replications of the chain, the corresponding estimated densities may be compared to assess how \close" the chains are to one another and to the true stationary distribution.  We explain how this may be done using both L 1 and L 2 distance measures.  We illustrate these new methods via the analysis of MCMC output arising from the study of first an autoregressive time series and then a collection censored survival data.
