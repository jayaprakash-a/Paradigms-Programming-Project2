The Bigger Hammer Approach: Using Massively Parallel Computation to Address Low Base Rate Problems
 Abstract This paper discusses the problem of modeling phenomena with a low base rate of occurrence using terrorism as an example.  The paper suggests that Data Farming---developing data sets through utilization of massive computation---may be a useful way to deal with this challenge.  An abstract model is described and analyzed as a simple case study.  Preliminary results are examined to provide support for the assertion that Data Farming has utility when modeling low base rate phenomena.  These results were surprising, which provided support for our position that without some understanding of the whole of the possibility space associated with a system; one cannot judge truly what a low base rate event is and what conditions lead to changes in the likelihood of said events.  The paper also discusses how the requirement for holistic understanding combined with current computational limits necessitate carefully designed experiments using distilled models that deal only with the essence of the question at hand.  Two pressing research issues are suggested at the paper's conclusion.
