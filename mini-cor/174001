DRAGON SYSTEMS' AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTION OF NEW TDT CORPUS
 ABSTRACT Dragon Systems has agreed to provide automatically generated transcripts for around 1000 hours of Broadcast News, annotated with word-level time-markings and confidence estimates.  Pilot transcripts of about 30 hours of data will be available sometime in February, with the project completed by mid-July.  In this paper, we describe how we took our 1997 Hub4 evaluation system which ran at around 140 times real time, and modified it to run around 6 times faster with virtually no increase in error rate.  We describe in detail the confidence algorithm, and show how it is a good predictor of which words were recognized correctly.
