A 19
2GOPS, 20mW Adaptive FIR Filter.  Abstract We implemented a 48-tap, mixed-signal adaptive FIR filter with 8-bit input and 10-bit output resolution.  The filter stores its tap weights in nonvolatile analog memory cells and adapts using the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm.  We run the input through a digital tapped delay line, multiply the digital words with the analog tap weights using mixed-signal multipliers, and adapt the tap coefficients using pulse-based feedback.  The accuracy of the weight updates exceeds 13 bits.  The total die area is 2. 6mm 2 in a 0. 35m CMOS process.  The filter delivers a performance of 19. 2GOPS at 200MHz, and consumes 20mW providing a 6mA differential output current.
