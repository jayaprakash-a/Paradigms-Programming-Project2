Dense Matching of Multiple Wide-baseline Views
 Abstract This paper describes a PDE-based method for dense depth extraction from multiple wide-baseline images.  Emphasis lies on the usage of only a small amount of images.  The integration of these multiple wide-baseline views is guided by the relative confidence that the system has in the matching to different views.  This weighting is fine-grained in that it is determined for every pixel at every iteration.  Reliable information spreads fast at the expense of less reliable data, both in terms of spatial communications within a view and in terms of information exchange between the views.  Changes in intensity between images can be handled in a similar fine grained fashion.
