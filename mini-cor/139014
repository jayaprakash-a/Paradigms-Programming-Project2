BIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON CONNECTIONIST MODELLING
 ABSTRACT Many researchers interested in connectionist models accept that such models are "neurally inspired" but do not worry too much about whether their models are biologically realistic.  While such a position may be perfectly justifiable, the present paper attempts to illustrate how biological information can be used to constrain connectionist models.  Two particular areas are discussed.  The first section deals with visual information processing in the primate and human visual system.  It is argued that speed with which visual information is processed imposes major constraints on the architecture and operation of the visual system.  In particular, it seems that a great deal of processing must depend on a single bottum-up pass.  The second section deals with biological aspects of learning algorithms.  It is argued that although there is good evidence for certain coactivation related synaptic modification schemes, other learning mechanisms, including back-propagation, are not currently supported by experimental data.
