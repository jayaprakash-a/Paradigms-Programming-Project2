Enhancing usability in CITIDEL: multimodal, multilingual, and interactive visualization interfaces
 ABSTRACT CITIDEL employs a modular system design to support education in computer science and related fields.  By taking advantage of its modular nature, we have made interface enhancements that draw from different fields in computer science.  Examples are the incorporation of interactive visualizations, usability enhancements, multimodal interactions, and community multilingual translation.  Pilot studies demonstrate the resulting improvements in quality, as measured across a number of metrics.
