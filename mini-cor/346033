Names and Faces
 Abstract We show that a large and realistic face dataset can be built from news photographs and their associated captions.  Our dataset consists of 44,773 face images, obtained by applying a face finder to approximately half a million captioned news images.  This dataset is more realistic than usual face recognition datasets, because it contains faces captured "in the wild" in a variety of configurations with respect to the camera, taking a variety of expressions, and under illumination of widely varying color.  Faces are extracted from the images and names from the associated caption.  Our system uses a clustering procedure to find the correspondence between faces and associated names in news picture-caption pairs.  The context in which a name appears in a caption provides powerful cues as to whether it is depicted in the associated image.  By incorporating simple natural language techniques, we are able to improve our name assignment significantly.  Once the procedure is complete, we have an accurately labeled set of faces, an appearance model for each individual depicted, and a natural language model that can produce accurate results on captions in isolation.
