A Markovian Lattice Model for the Acquisition of Morphological Structure
 Abstract We describe a new formalism for word morphology.  Our model views word generation as a random walk on a lattice of units where each unit is a set of (short) strings.  The model naturally incorporates segmentation of words into morphemes.  We capture the statistics of unit generation using a probabilistic suffix tree (PST) which is a variant of variable length Markov models.  We present an efficient algorithm that learns a PST over the units whose output is a compact stochastic representation of morphological structure.  We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by using the model in an allomorphy decision problem.
