Neuromorphic vision sensors and preprocessors in system applications
 ABSTRACT A partial review of neuromorphic vision sensors that are suitable for use in autonomous systems is presented.  Interfaces are being developed to multiplex the high-dimensional output signals of arrays of such sensors and to communicate them in standard formats to off-chip devices for higher-level processing, actuation, storage and display.  Alternatively, on-chip processing stages may be implemented to extract sparse image parameters, thereby obviating the need for multiplexing.  Autonomous robots are used to test neuromorphic vision chips in real-world environments and to explore the possibilities of data fusion from different sensing modalities.  Examples of autonomous mobile systems that use neuromorphic vision chips for line tracking and optical flow matching are described.
