The Bas-Relief Ambiguity
 Abstract Since antiquity, artisans have created flattened forms, often called "bas-reliefs," which give an exaggerated perception of depth when viewed from a particular vantage point.  This paper presents an explanation of this phenomena, showing that the ambiguity in determining the relief of an object is not confined to bas-relief sculpture but is implicit in the determination of the structure of any object.  Formally, if the object's true surface is denoted by z true = f(x; y), then we define the "generalized bas-relief transformation" as z = f(x; y) + x + y; with a corresponding transformation of the albedo.  For each image of a Lambertian surface f(x; y) produced by a point light source at infinity, there exists an identical image of a bas-relief produced by a transformed light source.  This equality holds for both shaded and shadowed regions.  Thus, the set of possible images (illumination cone) is invariant over generalized bas-relief transformations.  When = = 0 (e. g.  a classical bas-relief sculpture), we show that the set of possible motion fields are also identical.  Thus, neither small unknown motions nor changes of illumination can resolve the bas-relief ambiguity.  Implications of this ambiguity on structure recovery and shape representation are discussed.
