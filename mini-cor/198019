Models, assumptions, and model checking in ecological regressions \Lambda
 Abstract Ecological regression is based on assumptions that are untestable from aggregate data.  However, these assumptions seem more questionable in some applications than others.  There has been some research on implicit models of individual data underlying aggregate ecological regression modeling.  We discuss ways in which these implicit models can be checked from aggregate data.  We also explore the differences in applications of ecological regressions in two examples: estimating the effect of radon on lung cancer in the United States, and estimating voting patterns for different ethnic groups in New York City.
