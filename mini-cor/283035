Optimizing the Layout of a Balanced Tree
 This paper is related to computational and structural complexity, graph drawing.  We exhibit in this article layouts of balanced m-ary trees on a grid that are optimal with regard to their total wire length (up to lower order terms).  It is shown that the total wire length of layouts of a balanced binary tree on a 2-dimensional grid can be reduced by 33 % if one does not choose the obvious \symmetric" layout strategy.  Neither the construction of the optimal layout, nor the proof of its optimality, are obvious.  Hence the results of this paper appear to be of interest not only from the point of view of practical circuit design, but also from the theoretical point of view.
