Automated Event Detection in Space Instruments: A Case Study Using IPEX-2 Data and Support Vector Machines
 ABSTRACT This paper discusses our ongoing experimental work to train classifier software for automated detection of rare events of interest in space instruments.  As a concrete real-world example, this paper focuses on the task of detecting possible thermal snap events, using accelerometer data describing the movements of the boom structure during the 1997 IPEX-2 experiment.  In particular, this paper explores the use of recent promising techniques for automated classification based on support vector machines.
