Field Testing the Tongues Speech-to-Speech Machine Translation System
 Abstract The Tongues portable, rapid-development, speech-to-speech machine translation system was developed specifically to allow a realistic field-test of a deployable prototype.  In this paper we will describe the system, its field-testing using regular US Army officers and naive Croatians, and the evaluation of these tests.  The evaluation includes analysis of answers to a questionnaire, analysis of system transcript logs, and the authors' qualitative observations.  The overall result of the test was that while the system did successfully aid translation, it requires further development before it would be ready for regular field use.
