An Analog VLSI Chip with Asynchronous Interface for Auditory Feature Extraction
 Abstract--- We describe the architecture and circuit implementation of an analog VLSI feature extraction chip that has an asynchronous digital interface and is designed to serve as an auditory based front-end for a digit recognition system.  The single chip system encodes signal energies and level crossing time intervals of frequency components in a cochlear filter bank.  The chip has been fabricated in a 1. 2 m n-well, double polysilicon double metal CMOS process and it is fully functional.  Power consumption when operated from 5 Volt supply is only a few milliwatts.
