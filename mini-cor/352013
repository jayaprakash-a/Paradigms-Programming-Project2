Organization of face and object recognition in modular neural network models
 Abstract There is strong evidence that face processing in the brain is localized.  The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms.  In this paper, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to (1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, (2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and (3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth.
