Recognition Performance of a Structured Language Model
 ABSTRACT A new language model for speech recognition inspired by linguistic analysis is presented.  The model develops hidden hierarchical structure incrementally and uses it to extract meaningful information from the word history --- thus enabling the use of extended distance dependencies --- in an attempt to complement the locality of currently used trigram models.  The structured language model, its probabilistic parameterization and performance in a two-pass speech recognizer are presented.  Experiments on the SWITCHBOARD corpus show an improvement in both perplexity and word error rate over conventional trigram models.
