A Probabilistic Framework for Joint Head Tracking and Pose Estimation
 Abstract Head Tracking and pose estimation are usually considered as two sequential and separate problems: pose is estimated on the head patch provided by a tracking module.  However, precision in head pose estimation is dependent on tracking accuracy which itself could benefit from the head orientation knowledge.  Therefore, this work considers head tracking and pose estimation as two coupled problems in a probabilistic setting.  Head pose models are learned and incorporated into a mixed-state particle filter framework for joint head tracking and pose estimation.  Experimental results on real sequences show the effectiveness of the method in estimating more stable and accurate pose values.
