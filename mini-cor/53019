Combined Color And Texture Segmentation by Parametric Distributional Clustering
 Abstract Unsupervised image segmentation can be formulated as a clustering problem in which pixels or small image patches are grouped together based on local feature information.  In this contribution, parametric distributional clustering (PDC) is presented as a novel approach to image segmentation based on color and texture clues.  The objective function of the PDC model is derived from the recently proposed Information Bottleneck framework (Tishby et al.  [8]), but it can equivalently be formulated in terms of a maximum likelihood solution.  Its optimization is performed by deterministic annealing.  Segmentation results are shown for natural wildlife imagery.
