Casimir attraction in colloidal crystals
 Experimental evidence collected over 20 years [1] suggests that similarly charged colloidal spheres dispersed in water need not simply repel each other.  Under some circumstances they instead experience an unexpected long-ranged attraction.  For example, like-charge attractions are implicated in the cohesion of metastable superheated colloidal crystals [2, 3] even though isolated pairs of the constituent spheres are observed to repel each other [4, 5].  Comparable attractions have been measured for pairs of spheres confined by two [5, 6] charged planar walls.  Recent calculations [7, 8] reveal that such confinement-induced attractions cannot be accounted for by local density theory nor by electrohydrodynamic coupling [9, 10].  Such anomalous effects in charge-stabilized colloid therefore challenge our general understanding of interactions and dynamics in macroionic systems.  This letter addresses fluctuations' contribution to the free energy of highly charged colloidal spheres surrounded by a neutralizing cloud of small singly charged counterions.  Highly symmetric monopolar fluctuations in the counterion distribution increase the system's free energy.  We demonstrate that their suppression by boundary conditions at the spheres' surfaces introduces a long-range attraction into the crystal's free energy analogous to the Casimir force in quantum electrodynamics, but that it is too weak to account for anomalous behavior in charge-stabilized suspensions.  Our treatment is based on the Wigner-Seitz cell model introduced by Wennerstrom, Jonsson and Linse [11] which has been studied extensively [12] both theoretically and through Monte Carlo simulation.  It consists of a single spherical macroion of radius a carrying a uniformly distributed surface charge -Ze and surrounded by a thermal cloud of Z point-like counterions at temperature T , each carrying a single charge e.  The macroion and counterions c # EDP Sciences are confined by a concentric conducting spherical shell of radius R.  This outer shell plays a role analogous to the Wigner-Seitz cell boundary in a colloidal crystal.  More generally, it models the crowding or geometric confinement characteristic of colloidal crystals [13].  Previous investigations of this and related models [12,14] have found short-ranged correlation-driven attractions between the bounding surfaces under some conditions, particularly when the counterions are polyvalent.  They have not found evidence for long-ranged attractions in monovalent electrolytes [13].  Our method for evaluating the counterions' partition function allows us to investigate much higher macroion charges than have been considered before.  The outer boundary's suppression of counterion fluctuations induces a long-ranged Casimir-like attraction [14] between the macroion and its neighbors across the Wigner-Seitz cell boundary.  Although this cell model is far too simple to describe the behavior of real charge-stabilized suspensions, it highlights a previously unexplored mechanism for long-ranged confinement-induced like-charge colloidal attractions.  We adopt the path integral formalism reviewed in [14] and write the counterions' canonical partition function as a functional integral over all possible counterion distributions, n(#r): Q = # 2#Z Z Z # # e -#f[n] Dn, (1) where # -1 = kBT is the thermal energy scale at temperature T , the prime indicates that the number of charges is conserved ( # ndV = Z), and [15] f [n]=U [n]+kBT # n ln ndV . The potential-energy functional U [n]= 1 2 # ne#dV describes the counterions' interaction with the local electric potential #(#r).  The system's Helmholtz free energy is then F = -kBT ln Q.  One ionic distribution, n 0 (#r), minimizes f , and thus has the greatest statistical weight in Q.  We factor the partition function Q = Q 0 Q fl into the saddle point contribution Q 0 = Z Z e -#f 0 , where f 0 = f [n 0 ], and a term Q fl accounting for fluctuations, fin, away from n 0 .  Expressing Q fl as a series expansion in fin yields, as the lowest-order non-vanishing term, Q fl # # 2#Z # # e -fiff 2 f Dn, (2) where # 2 f is the second-order change in f [n] due to fin.  Terminating this expansion at Gaussian order is justified if corrections at higher order in fin contribute negligibly to Q fl .  This condition is met if Z is large [16] and n 0 (r) itself changes negligibly over the mean radial counterion separation: 1 n 0 dn 0 dr # 4#r 2 n 0 , (3) and can be tested a posteriori once n 0 (r) is evaluated.  Expanding around any other distribution [17, 18] would not give such a criterion for establishing convergence.  It has been shown [16, 18] that the saddle point corresponds to the mean-field result n 0 = n s e -#e# which, combined with the Poisson equation # 2 # = - en # , yields the familiar Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, # 2 # =en s # e -#e# .  (4) Selecting n s =3Z/ (4#a 3 ) sets the potential's reference point conveniently without loss of generality.  Equation (4) accounts for the solvent's influence in the so-called primitive model through its dielectric constant #.
