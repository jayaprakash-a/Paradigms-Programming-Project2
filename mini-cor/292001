Dynamic Linear Models, Recursive Least Squares and Steepest-Descent Learning
 Abstract In this short research note we highlight the differences between Dynamic Linear Models, Recursive Least Squares and Steepest-Descent Learning.  All models are viewed as special cases of linear dynamical systems and their learning rules as special cases of the Kalman filter.  Steepest-Descent Learning is a fixed learning rate algorithm for modelling stationary data.  Recursive Least Squares is an adaptive learning rate algorithm for modelling stationary data.  Dynamic Linear Models are adaptive learning rate algorithms for modelling stationary and non-stationary data.  They have state-noise and observation noise parameters which can be updated on-line so as to maximise the evidence of the observations.
