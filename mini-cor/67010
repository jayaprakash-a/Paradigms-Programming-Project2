Surface Tortuosity and its Application to Analyzing Cracks in Concrete
 Abstract Previous studies of tortuosity were restricted to a curve in 2D or 3D.  We propose several measures of surface tortuosity based on surface normals and principal curvatures, and apply these measures to analyze the tortuosity of threedimensional crack surfaces of concrete.  We show that all crack surfaces are similar in tortuosity despite their different sizes and locations, while distinctive from various geometric surfaces.
