Tutorial on variational approximation methods
 Abstract We provide an introduction to the theory and use of variational methods for inference and estimation in the context of graphical models.  Variational methods become useful as ecient approximate methods when the structure of the graph model no longer admits feasible exact probabilistic calculations.  The emphasis of this tutorial is on illustrating how inference and estimation problems can be transformed into variational form along with describing the resulting approximation algorithms and their properties insofar as these are currently known.
