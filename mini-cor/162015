Frame, Reproducing Kernel, Regularization and Learning
 Abstract This work deals with a method for building Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) from a Hilbert space with frame elements having special properties.  Conditions on existence and a method of construction are given.  Then, these RKHS are used within the framework of regularization theory for function approximation.  Implications on semiparametric estimation are discussed and a multiscale scheme of regularization is also proposed.  Results on toy and real-world approximation problems illustrate the effectiveness of such methods.
