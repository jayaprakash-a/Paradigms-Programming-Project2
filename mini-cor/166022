Estimation of 3D Surface Shape and Smooth Radiance from 2D Images: A Level Set Approach
 We cast the problem of shape reconstruction of a scene as the global region segmentation of a collection of calibrated images.  We assume that the scene is composed of a number of smooth surfaces and a background, both of which support smooth Lambertian radiance functions.  We formulate the problem in a variational framework, where the solution (both the shape and radiance of the scene) is a minimizer of a global cost functional which combines a geometric prior on shape, a smoothness prior on radiance and a data fitness score.  We estimate the shape and radiance via an alternating minimization: The radiance is computed as the solutions of partial differential equations defined on the surface and the background.  The shape is estimated using a gradient descent flow, which is implemented using the level set method.  Our algorithm works for scenes with smooth radiances as well as fine homogeneous textures, which are known challenges to traditional stereo algorithms based on local correspondence.
