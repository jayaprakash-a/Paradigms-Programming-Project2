Variational Belief Networks for Approximate Inference
 Abstract Exact inference in large, densely connected probabilistic networks is computationally intractable, and approximate schemes are therefore of great importance.  One approach is to use mean field theory, in which the exact log-likelihood is bounded from below using a simpler approximating distribution.  In the standard mean field theory, the approximating distribution is factorial.  We propose instead to use a (tractable) belief network as an approximating distribution.  The resulting compact framework is analogous to standard mean field theory and no additional bounds are required, in contrast to other recently proposed extensions.  We derive mean field equations which provide an efficient iterative algorithm to optimize the parameters of the approximating belief network.  Simulation results indicate a considerable improvement on previously reported methods.
