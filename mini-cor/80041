Adaptive game playing using multiplicative weights
 Abstract We present a simple algorithm for playing a repeated game.  We show that a player using this algorithm suffers average loss that is guaranteed to come close to the minimum loss achievable by any fixed strategy.  Our bounds are non-asymptotic and hold for any opponent.  The algorithm, which uses the multiplicative-weight methods of Littlestone and Warmuth, is analyzed using the Kullback-Liebler divergence.  This analysis yields a new, simple proof of the minmax theorem, as well as a provable method of approximately solving a game.  A variant of our game-playing algorithm is proved to be optimal in a very strong sense.
