Adaptive Margin Support Vector Machines for Classification
 Abstract In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm for classification learning based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach.  Existing approaches for constructing SVMs [12] are based on minimization of a regularized margin loss where the margin is treated equivalently for each training pattern.  We propose a reformulation of the minimization problem such that adaptive margins for each training pattern are utilized, which we call the Adaptive Margin (AM--) SVM.  We give bounds on the generalization error of AM--SVMs which justify their robustness against outliers, and show experimentally that the generalization error of AM--SVMs is comparable to classical SVMs on benchmark datasets from the UCI repository.
