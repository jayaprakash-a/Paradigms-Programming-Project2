Effects of lateral competition in the primary visual cortex on the development of topographic projections and ocular dominance maps
 Abstract We present a Hebbian model for the development of cortical maps in the striate cortex that includes a parameter which represents the degree of lateral competition for activity between neurons.  It has two well known models as limiting cases: for weak competition we obtain a Correlation Based Learning (CBL) model and for strong lateral competition we recover the Self Organizing Map (SOM).  We show that incresing the competition for positively correlated localized stimuli leads to a sharp transition from an unorganized map to a topographic projection and subesequently to a topographic map with OD and locally magnified OD stripes.
