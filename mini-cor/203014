The Candide System for Machine Translation
 ABSTRACT We present an overview of Candide, a system for automatic translation of French text to English text.  Candide uses methods of information theory and statistics to develop a probability model of the translation process.  This model, which is made to accord as closely as possible with a large body of French and English sentence pairs, is then used to generate English translations of previously unseen French sentences.  This paper provides a tutorial in these methods, discussions of the training and operation of the system, and a summary of test results.
