FRAME-FREE VIDEO
 ABSTRACT Current digital video representations emphasize compression efficiency, lacking some of the flexibility required for interactive manipulation of digital bitstreams.  In this work, we present a video representation which can encompass both space and time, providing a temporally coherent description of video sequences.  The video sequence is segmented into its component objects, and the trajectory of each object throughout the sequence is described parametrically, according to a spatiotemporal motion model.  Since the motion model is a continuous function of time, the video representation becomes frame-rate independent and temporal resolution a user-definable parameter.  I. e.  the traditional sequence of frames, with temporal structure hardcoded into the bitstream at the time of production, is replaced by a collection of scene snapshots assembled on the fly by the decoder.  This enables random access and temporal scalability, the major building blocks for interactivity.
