A model of the leech segmental swim central pattern generator
 Abstract We present a model of the single-ganglion oscillator of the leech swim central pattern generator (CPG).  The model is based on the known neuronal architecture of this circuit.  Free parameters in the model were "tted to produce membrane potential oscillations matching those seen during swimming.  However, the oscillations produced are not robust to small ($5%) changes in the parameters.  We propose that this may be due to the large di!erence between the passive time constant of our model cells and the period of the swim oscillation.  We discuss possible ways the real circuit achieves robustness.
