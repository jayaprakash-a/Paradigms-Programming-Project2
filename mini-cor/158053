Computation in Noisy Radio Networks
 Abstract In this paper we examine noisy radio (broadcast) networks in which every bit transmitted has a certain probability to be flipped.  Each processor has some initial input bit, and the goal is to compute a function of the initial inputs.  In this model we show a protocol to compute any threshold function using only a linear number of transmissions.
