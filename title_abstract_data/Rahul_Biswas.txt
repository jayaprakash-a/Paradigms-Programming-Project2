A Probabilistic Approach to Inference with Limited Information in Sensor Networks| ABSTRACT We present a methodology for a sensor network to answer queries with limited and stochastic information using probabilistic techniques.  This capability is useful in that it allows sensor networks to answer queries effectively even when present information is partially corrupt and when more information is unavailable or too costly to obtain.  We use a Bayesian network to model the sensor network and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference.  We demonstrate our technique on the specific problem of determining whether a friendly agent is surrounded by enemy agents and present simulation results for it. 
Exceptionally directional sources with photonic-bandgap crystals| Three-dimensional photonic-bandgap crystals are used to design and fabricate uniquely directional sources and receivers.  By utilizing the resonances of a Fabry--Perot cavity formed with photonic-bandgap crystals, we were able to create exceptionally directional sources by placing the sources within such a cavity.  Very good agreement between finite-difference time-domain calculations and the experiment is obtained.  Radiation patterns with half-power beam widths of less than 12 degrees were obtained.  2001 Optical Society of America

Quantum Phase Transitions Outside the Wilson Landau Ginzburg Paradigm| Abstract We review certain aspects of quantum phase transititions.  We then report on certain recent theoretical advances in the study of quantum phase transitions in the context of two dimensional quantum magnets, which do not fit into the Ginbzburg-Landau-Wilson (GLW) formalism usually used to study phase transitions.
