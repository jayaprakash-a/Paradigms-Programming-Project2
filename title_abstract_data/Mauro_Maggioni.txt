Value Function Approximation with Diffusion Wavelets and Laplacian Eigenfunctions| Abstract We investigate the problem of automatically constructing efficient representations or basis functions for approximating value functions based on analyzing the structure and topology of the state space.  In particular, two novel approaches to value function approximation are explored based on automatically constructing basis functions on state spaces that can be represented as graphs or manifolds: one approach uses the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, in effect performing a global Fourier analysis on the graph; the second approach is based on diffusion wavelets, which generalize classical wavelets to graphs using multiscale dilations induced by powers of a diffusion operator or random walk on the graph.  Together, these approaches form the foundation of a new generation of methods for solving large Markov decision processes, in which the underlying representation and policies are simultaneously learned. 
Fast Direct Policy Evaluation using Multiscale Analysis of Markov Diffusion Processes| Abstract Policy evaluation is a critical step in the approximate solution of large Markov decision processes (MDPs), typically requiring O(|S| 3 ) to directly solve the Bellman system of |S| linear equations (where |S| is the state space size).  In this paper we apply a recently introduced multiscale framework for analysis on graphs to design a faster algorithm for policy evaluation.  For a fixed policy #, this framework efficiently constructs a multiscale decomposition of the random walk P # associated with the policy #.  This enables efficiently computing medium and long term state distributions, approximation of value functions, and the direct computation of the potential operator (I - #P # )- 1 needed to solve Bellman's equation.  We show that even a preliminary non-optimized version of the solver competes with highly optimized iterative techniques, and can be computed in time O(|S| log 2 |S|).
