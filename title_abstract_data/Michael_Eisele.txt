Hidden Markov Model of Cortical Synaptic Plasticity: Derivation of the Learning Rule| Abstract Cortical synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes and also on the temporal pattern of presynaptic spikes and of postsynaptic spikes.  We study the hypothesis that cortical synaptic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole response periods, and depends only on when response periods start, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes.  Here we present the mathematical background for such a study.  Standard methods from hidden Markov models are used to define what "response periods" are.  Estimating the probability of being in such a response period requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes.  We will show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates pre- and postsynaptic response periods as if it also knew future spikes.  We will also indicate that this learning rule seems to agree well with synaptic plasticity in superficial layers of rat visual cortex (
