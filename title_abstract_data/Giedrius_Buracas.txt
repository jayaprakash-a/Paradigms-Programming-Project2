Global feature-based attention for motion and color| Abstract We used a divided attention psychophysical task to test the hypothesis that visual attention to a stimulus feature 1 facilitates the processing of other stimuli sharing the same feature.  Performance on a dual-task was significantly better when human observers divided attention across two spatially separate stimuli sharing a common feature (same direction of motion or same color) compared to opposing features.  This attentional effect was dependent upon the presence of competing stimuli.  These results are consistent with a spatially global feature-based mechanism of attention that increases the response of cortical neurons tuned to an attended feature throughout the visual field.
