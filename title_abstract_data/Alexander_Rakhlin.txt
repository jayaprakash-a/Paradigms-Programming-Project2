ESAIM: Probability and Statistics Will be set by the publisher URL:| Abstract.  In this paper we focus on the problem of estimating a bounded density using a finite combination of densities from a given class.  We consider the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the greedy procedure described by Li and Barron [7, 8] under the additional assumption of the compactness of the domain.  We prove an O( 1 p n ) bound on the estimation error which does not depend on the number of densities in the estimated combination.  Under the assumption of compactness of the domain, this improves the bound of Li and Barron by removing the log n factor and also generalizes it to the base classes with converging Dudley integral.  1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.
