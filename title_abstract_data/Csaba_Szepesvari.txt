Sequential Importance Sampling for Visual Tracking Reconsidered| Abstract We consider the task of filtering dynamical systems observed in noise by means of sequential importance sampling when the proposal is restricted to the innovation components of the state.  It is argued that the unmodified sequential importance sampling/resampling (SIR) algorithm may yield high variance estimates of the posterior in this case, resulting in poor performance when e. g.  in visual tracking one tries to build a SIR algorithm on the top of the output of a color blob detector.  A new method that associates the innovations sampled from the proposal and the particles in a separate computational step is proposed.  The method is shown to outperform the unmodified SIR algorithm in a series of vision based object tracking experiments, both in terms of accuracy and robustness. 
Interpolation-based Q-learning| Abstract We consider a variant of Q-learning in continuous state spaces under the total expected discounted cost criterion combined with local function approximation methods.  Provided that the function approximator satisfies certain interpolation properties, the resulting algorithm is shown to converge with probability one.  The limit function is shown to satisfy a fixed point equation of the Bellman type, where the fixed point operator depends on the stationary distribution of the exploration policy and the function approximation method.  The basic algorithm is extended in several ways.  In particular, a variant of the algorithm is obtained that is shown to converge in probability to the optimal Q function.  Preliminary computer simulations are presented that confirm the validity of the approach.
