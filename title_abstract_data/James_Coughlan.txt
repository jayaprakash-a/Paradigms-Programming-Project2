Measurement of Charged Particle Transverse Momentum Spectra in Deep Inelastic Scattering| Abstract Transverse momentum spectra of charged particles produced in deep inelastic scattering are measured as a function of the kinematic variables x and Q 2 using the H1 detector at the ep collider HERA.  The data are compared to different parton emission models, either with or without ordering of the emissions in transverse momentum.  The data provide evidence for a relatively large amount of parton radiation between the current and the remnant systems.

The CMS Tracker front-end and control electronics in an LHC like beam test| Abstract A complete prototype of the CMS tracker read-out and control system has been built using components as close as possible to the final design.  It is based on an amplifier and analogue pipeline memory chip (APV), analogue optical links transmitting at 40Ms/s and a VME mounted digitisation and data handling board (FED-PMC), supplemented by a control architecture based on FECs which set and monitor the components of the entire system.  This system has been successfully operated for the first time under LHC like beam conditions in a 25ns structured beam provided by the SPS at CERN.  The objective was primarily to test the synchronisation and pile-up effects in a high trigger rate environment and to examine the many issues involved in operating a complete readout and control system. 
Observation of Events with an Isolated High Energy Lepton and Missing Transverse Momentum at HERA| Abstract A search for events with an imbalance in transverse momentum and with isolated high energy leptons has been carried out at the positron-proton collider HERA.  One event with an4 and five events with a # # are found together with evidence for undetected particles carrying transverse momentum.  Within the Standard Model the dominant origin of events with this kind of topology is the production of # bosons with subsequent leptonic decay.  Three of the six events are within measurement errors found in a region of phase space likely to be populated by this process, while the remaining events show kinematic properties which are atypical of all Standard Model processes considered.

The Manhattan World Assumption: Regularities in Scene Statistics which Enable Bayesian Inference| Abstract Preliminary work by the authors made use of the so-called \Manhattan world" assumption about the scene statistics of city and indoor scenes.  This assumption stated that such scenes were built on a cartesian grid which led to regularities in the image edge gradient statistics.  In this paper we explore the general applicability of this assumption and show that, surprisingly, it holds in a large variety of less structured environments including rural scenes.  This enables us, from a single image, to determine the orientation of the viewer relative to the scene structure and also to detect target objects which are not aligned with the grid.  These inferences are performed using a Bayesian model with probability distributions (e. g.  on the image gradient statistics) learnt from real data. 
A Bayesian Network Framework for Relational Shape Matching| Abstract A Bayesian network formulation for relational shape matching is presented.  The main advantage of the relational shape matching approach is the obviation of the non-rigid spatial mappings used by recent non-rigid matching approaches.  The basic variables that need to be estimated in the relational shape matching objective function are the global rotation and scale and the local displacements and correspondences.  The new Bethe free energy approach is used to estimate the pairwise correspondences between links of the template graphs and the data.  The resulting framework is useful in both registration and recognition contexts.  Results are shown on hand-drawn templates and on 2D transverse T1-weighted MR images. 
Search for Leptoquark Bosons in ep Collisions at HERA| Abstract A search for scalar and vector leptoquarks coupling to first generation fermions is performed using the e + p and e- p scattering data collected by the H1 experiment between 1994 and 2000.  The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 117 pb- 1 .  No evidence for the direct or indirect production of such particles is found in data samples with a large transverse momentum final state electron or with large missing transverse momentum.  Constraints on leptoquark models are established.  For leptoquark couplings of electromagnetic strength, leptoquarks with masses up to 275- 325 GeV are ruled out.  These limits improve and supercede earlier H1 limits based on subsamples of the data used here. 
The g Factor: Relating Distributions on Features to Distributions on Images| Abstract We describe the g-factor, which relates probability distributions on image features to distributions on the images themselves.  The g-factor depends only on our choice of features and lattice quantization and is independent of the training image data.  We illustrate the importance of the g-factor by analyzing how the parameters of Markov Random Field (i. e.  Gibbs or log-linear) probability models of images are learned from data by maximum likelihood estimation.  In particular, we study homogeneous MRF models which learn image distributions in terms of clique potentials corresponding to feature histogram statistics (cf.  Minimax Entropy Learning (MEL) by Zhu, Wu and Mumford 1997 [11]).  We first use our analysis of the g-factor to determine when the clique potentials decouple for different features.  Second, we show that clique potentials can be computed analytically by approximating the g-factor.  Third, we demonstrate a connection between this approximation and the Generalized Iterative Scaling algorithm (GIS), due to Darroch and Ratcliff 1972 [2], for calculating potentials.  This connection enables us to use GIS to improve our multinomial approximation, using Bethe-Kikuchi[8] approximations to simplify the GIS procedure.  We support our analysis by computer simulations.
