An ensemble-based smoother with optimized weights for highly nonlinear systems| Abstract Monte Carlo computational methods have been introduced into data assimilation for nonlinear systems in order to alleviate the computational burden of propagating the system's full probability distribution.  By propagating an ensemble of representative states, algorithms like the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and Resampled Particle Filter (RPF) rely on the existing modeling infrastructure to compute and assign the weights to the data based on the evolution of this ensemble.  This work presents an ensemble-based smoother that is applicable to Monte Carlo filtering schemes like the EnKF and RPF.  At the minor cost of retrospectively updating a set of weights for ensemble members, this smoother provides superior state tracking for two simple nonlinear problems, the double-well potential and trivariate Lorenz system.  The algorithm does not require retrospective adaptation of the ensemble members themselves, and it is thus suited to a streaming operational mode.  The accuracy of the proposed backwardupdate scheme in estimating non-Gaussian distributions is evaluated by comparison to the more accurate estimates provided by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
