DRAGON SYSTEMS' AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTION OF NEW TDT CORPUS| ABSTRACT Dragon Systems has agreed to provide automatically generated transcripts for around 1000 hours of Broadcast News, annotated with word-level time-markings and confidence estimates.  Pilot transcripts of about 30 hours of data will be available sometime in February, with the project completed by mid-July.  In this paper, we describe how we took our 1997 Hub4 evaluation system which ran at around 140 times real time, and modified it to run around 6 times faster with virtually no increase in error rate.  We describe in detail the confidence algorithm, and show how it is a good predictor of which words were recognized correctly. 
DRAGON SYSTEMS' 1998 BROADCAST NEWS TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEM FOR MANDARIN| ABSTRACT In this paper we shall describe Dragon Systems' 1998 Broadcast News transcription system for Mandarin.  We shall describe our music classifier, which was unique to our Mandarin system, as well as our speaker change detection algorithm, which was used in our English and Mandarin systems.  We shall also report on preliminary, post-evaluation experiments with pitch.
