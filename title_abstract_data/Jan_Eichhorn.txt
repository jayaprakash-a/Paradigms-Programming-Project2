Prediction on Spike Data Using Kernel Algorithms| Abstract We report and compare the performance of different learning algorithms based on data from cortical recordings.  The task is to predict the orientation of visual stimuli from the activity of a population of simultaneously recorded neurons.  We compare several ways of improving the coding of the input (i. e. , the spike data) as well as of the output (i. e. , the orientation), and report the results obtained using different kernel algorithms.
