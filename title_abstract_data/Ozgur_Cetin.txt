THE 2001 GMTK-BASED SPINE ASR SYSTEM| ABSTRACT This paper provides a detailed description of the University of Washington automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for the 2001 DARPA SPeech In Noisy Environments (SPINE) task.  Our system makes heavy use of the graphical modeling toolkit (GMTK), a general purpose graphical modeling-based ASR system that allows arbitrary parameter tying, flexible deterministic and stochastic dependencies between variables, and a generalized maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm.  In our SPINE system, GMTK was used for acoustic model training whereas feature extraction, speaker adaptation, and first-pass decoding were performed by HTK.  Our integrated GMTK/HTK system demonstrates the relative merits provided by each tool.  Novel aspects of our SPINE system include the capturing of correlations among feature vectors via a globally-shared factored sparse inverse covariance matrix and generalized EM training. 
Further Progress in Meeting Recognition: The ICSI-SRI Spring 2005 Speech-to-Text Evaluation System| Abstract.  We describe the development of our speech recognition system for the NIST Spring 2005 Meeting Rich Transcription (RT-05S) evaluation, highlighting improvements made since last year [1].  The system is based on the SRIICSI-UW RT-04F conversational telephone speech (CTS)
