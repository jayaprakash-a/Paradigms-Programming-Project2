Minimising Contrastive Divergence in Noisy, Mixed-mode VLSI Neurons| Abstract This paper presents VLSI circuits with continuous-valued probabilistic behaviour realized by injecting noise into each computing unit(neuron).  Interconnecting the noisy neurons forms a Continuous Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM), which has shown promising performance in modelling and classifying noisy biomedical data.  The Minimising-Contrastive-Divergence learning algorithm for CRBM is also implemented in mixed-mode VLSI, to adapt the noisy neurons' parameters on-chip. 
Assessing RBF Networks Using DELVE| Abstract In this paper different methods for training radial basis function (RBF) networks for regression problems are described and illustrated.  Then, using data from the DELVE archive, they are empirically compared with each other and with some other well known methods for machine learning.  Each of the RBF methods performs well on at least one DELVE task, but none are as consistent as the best of the other non-RBF methods. 
Circuits for VLSI Implementation of Temporally-Asymmetric Hebbian Learning| Abstract Experimental data has shown that synaptic strength modification in some types of biological neurons depends upon precise spike timing differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes.  Several temporally-asymmetric Hebbian learning rules motivated by this data have been proposed.  We argue that such learning rules are suitable to analog VLSI implementation.  We describe an easily tunable circuit to modify the weight of a silicon spiking neuron according to those learning rules.  Test results from the fabrication of the circuit using a 0. 6m CMOS process are given. 
Combining Regression Trees and Radial Basis Function Networks| Abstract We describe a method for nonparametric regression which combines regression trees with radial basis function networks.  The method is similar to that of Kubat [1998], who was first to suggest such a combination, but has some significant improvements.  We demonstrate the features of the new method, compare its performance with other methods on DELVE data sets and apply it to a real world problem involving the classification of soybean plants from digital images.
