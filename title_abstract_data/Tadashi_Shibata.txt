A Mixed-Signal VLSI for Real-Time Generation of Edge-Based Image Vectors| Abstract A mixed-signal image filtering VLSI has been developed aiming at real-time generation of edge-based image vectors for robust image recognition.  A four-stage asynchronous median detection architecture based on analog digital mixed-signal circuits has been introduced to determine the threshold value of edge detection, the key processing parameter in vector generation.  As a result, a fully seamless pipeline processing from threshold detection to edge feature map generation has been established.  A prototype chip was designed in a 0. 35-4 m double-polysilicon three-metal-layer CMOS technology and the concept was verified by the fabricated chip.  The chip generates a 64-dimension feature vector from a 64x64-pixel gray scale image every 80 sec.  This is about 10 4 times faster than the software computation, making a real-time image recognition system feasible.
