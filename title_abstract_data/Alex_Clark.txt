Texture Deconvolution for the Fourier-Based Analysis of Non-Rectangular Regions| Abstract Fourier analysis is often used as a tool to facilitate the extraction of texture information from image data.  However, in situations where the texture patch does not entirely fill the region of analysis, information relating to the shape of the patch becomes entwined with its texture content, thus contaminating the Fourier spectrum and corrupting the texture information.  We propose the use of a frequency deconvolution algorithm to remove the artefacts introduced by shape components, permitting the Fourier-based analysis of non-rectangular image patches.  The algorithm is demostrated on a texture recognition task involving the entire Brodatz album.

The linking homomorphism of one-dimensional minimal sets| Abstract We introduce a way of characterizing the linking of one-dimensional minimal sets in threedimensional flows and carry out the characterization for some minimal sets within flows modelled by templates, with an emphasis on the linking of Denjoy continua.  We also show that any aperiodic minimal subshift of minimal block growth has a suspension which is homeomorphic to a Denjoy continuum. 
Bihomogeneity of solenoids| Abstract Solenoids are inverse limit spaces over regular covering maps of closed manifolds.  M. C.  McCord has shown that solenoids are topologically homogeneous and that they are principal bundles with a pro#nite structure group.  We show that if a solenoid is bihomogeneous, then its structure group contains an open abelian subgroup.  This leads to new examples of homogeneous continua that are not bihomogeneous.
