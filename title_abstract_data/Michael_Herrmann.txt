Dynamical Synapses Give Rise to a Power-Law Distribution of Neuronal Avalanches| Abstract There is experimental evidence that cortical neurons show avalanche activity with the intense of firing events being distributed as a power-law.  We present a biologically plausible extension of a neural network which exhibits a power-law avalanche distribution for a wide range of connectivity parameters.

Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Multiscale Problems Micro-macro transition for the atomic chain via Whitham's modulation equation| Abstract The subject matter of this paper is the thermodynamic description of the nonlinear atomic chain with temperature.  For this reason we consider special approximate solutions of Newton's equations, in which the atoms perform microscopic oscillations in form of modulated traveling waves.  We start with an existence result for periodic traveling wave with arbitrary large amplitudes, and study several examples including the harmonic chain, the hard sphere model, and the small-amplitude approximation.  Then we discuss the thermodynamic properties of traveling waves,
