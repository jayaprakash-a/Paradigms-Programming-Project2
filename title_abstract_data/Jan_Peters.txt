Context-Aware Services based on Secure Mobile Agents| Abstract: In this paper we introduce the concept of context-aware services as an extended form of locationbased services.  We describe a new architecture for realizing context-aware services which has a number of key benefits.  This architecture relays on mobile software agents as security-centric middleware.  Our approach allows to combine disjunct databases by establishing applicationdependant links between remote data sets with a proprietary access.  We describe all necessary roles and places to establish a multilateral security concept for all participants.
